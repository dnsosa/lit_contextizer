In contrast, lytic forms of cell death, such as RIPK3- and MLKL-driven necroptosis, and caspase-1/11-dependent pyroptosis, are postulated to be inflammatory via the release of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Recently, the function of apoptotic caspase-8 has been extended to the negative regulation of necroptosis, the cleavage of inflammatory interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) to its mature bioactive form, either directly or via the NLRP3 inflammasome, and the regulation of cytokine transcriptional responses. In view of these recent advances, human autoinflammatory diseases that are caused by mutations in cell death regulatory machinery are now associated with inappropriate inflammasome activation. In this review, we discuss the emerging crosstalk between cell death and innate immune cell inflammatory signalling, particularly focusing on novel non-apoptotic functions of caspase-8. We also highlight the growing number of autoinflammatory diseases that are associated with enhanced inflammasome function.", "text": "Apoptosis is a genetically encoded process essential for the removal of superfluous or damaged cells. Apoptotic cell death can promote phagocytic clearance of infected cells to limit pathogenic infections, 1 , 2 and is required to delete lymphocytes to prevent autoimmune disease. 3 Intrinsic \u2018mitochondria\u2010dependent\u2019 apoptosis is triggered by cellular stressors (for example, growth factor withdrawal) and is tightly regulated by the pro\u2010 and anti\u2010apoptotic members of the BCL\u20102 protein family (reviewed in Delbridge et al. 4 ). In contrast, the extrinsic \u2018death receptor\u2010mediated\u2019 apoptotic pathway is induced by ligand binding, which via a series of events can activate the death receptor complex or ripoptosome that activates caspase\u20108 ( Figure 1 ). Both pathways merge following initiator caspase activation to trigger the activation of effector caspases, caspase\u20103 and caspase\u20107, resulting in ordered cellular breakdown. Death receptor ligation not only induces caspase\u20108\u2010mediated apoptosis but also results in transcription factor activation ( Figure 1 ). Pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF), are potent activators of NF\u2010\u03baB, regulating the transcription of a variety of inflammatory genes, including TNF itself. In fact, enhanced TNF production and TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) signalling is associated with macrophage accumulation and inflammatory cytokine production in common autoimmune pathologies, such as Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Although biologics targeting TNF have proven relatively efficacious in the treatment of these common diseases, understanding the pathways that regulate TNFR1 signalling is key to identifying next\u2010generation therapies. This is particularly true in view of the crosstalk, and shared signalling components, of cell death and pattern recognition receptor (PRR)\u2010mediated innate immune signalling pathways. Similar to the death receptors, Toll\u2010like receptors (TLRs) detect pathogen molecules and host\u2010derived damage\u2010associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) to induce the transcription of death ligands, including TNF and directly trigger caspase\u20108\u2010dependent apoptosis and caspase\u2010independent necroptotic cell death. TLR signalling may therefore contribute to the pathogenic effects of TNF in autoimmune diseases, such as arthritis. In this review, we give an overview of innate immune and cell death signalling pathways, particularly focusing on pathways that signal to caspase\u20108. We outline non\u2010apoptotic functions for caspase\u20108, including its ability to repress necroptosis, regulate cytokine transcription, and interact with inflammasomes to direct their signalling. Importantly we describe emerging evidence suggesting that in specific circumstances caspase\u20108 activity determines how pro\u2010inflammatory interleukin\u20101\u03b2 (IL\u20101\u03b2) processing and activation occurs. Finally, we highlight the increasing number of autoinflammatory diseases linked to mutations in cell death machinery, which can lead to excessive inflammasome activation. TNF is expressed predominantly by activated macrophages and T lymphocytes, as a 26 kDa protein on the plasma membrane. Cleavage of transmembrane TNF by the metalloproteinase, TACE (TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010converting enzyme), results in the release of a 17 kDa soluble form. 5 Despite many studies focusing specifically on the soluble form of TNF, both membrane bound (mTNF) and soluble TNF (sTNF) are biologically active and accumulating evidence suggests that each form of TNF have distinct roles in inflammatory responses. For example, anti\u2010human TNF monoclonal antibodies (infliximab and adalimumab) and soluble human TNFRII (etanercept) are highly efficacious in neutralising sTNF to treat rheumatoid arthritis. In contrast, anti\u2010TNF biologicals, particularly etanercept fail in Crohn's disease possibly due to ineffective targeting of mTNF that drives localised pathology. 5 , 6 Binding of TNF to TNFR1 results in the formation of a pro\u2010survival TNF receptor signalling complex (TNFRSC; also known as complex\u2010I), comprising the core proteins, TNFR1\u2010associated death domain protein (TRADD), TNF receptor\u2010associated factor 2 (TRAF2), Receptor\u2010Interacting Protein Kinase 1 (RIPK1), cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAP1/cIAP2) and the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC, a hetero\u2010trimeric complex comprising SHARPIN, HOIL\u20101 and HOIP) ( Figure 1 ). Conformational changes in TNFR1 facilitate the intracellular recruitment of TRADD via common death domains (DD), which allows interactions between TRADD, TNFR1 and RIPK1. 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 TRAF2 associates directly with TRADD via a TRAF binding domain and acts as an adaptor for the recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligases, cIAP1 and cIAP2, via a cIAP1/2\u2010interacting motif (CIM). 11 The cIAPs are arguably the most important E3 ubiquitin ligases recruited to the TNFRSC, where they function to recruit LUBAC ( Figure 1 ). Subsequently, the cIAPs and LUBAC ubiquitylate NEMO and RIPK1 to promote cell survival through TAK1\u2010 and IKK\u2010dependent transcriptional activation of canonical NF\u2010\u03baB, resulting in cytokine (for example, TNF and IL\u20106) and pro\u2010survival protein (for example, c\u2010FLIP and cIAPs) induction. 12 The activation of NF\u2010\u03baB only constitutes one arm of the TNFRSC. When TNFR1 induced pro\u2010survival responses are compromised (loss of the IAPs or inhibition of TAK1), complex\u2010I dissociates from the receptor, and RIPK1 together with TRADD associate with the adaptor protein FADD (Fas\u2010associated protein with death domain) and pro\u2010caspase\u20108 to form complex\u2010II ( Figure 1 ). 7 This complex has the ability to drive apoptosis through the dimerisation and auto\u2010activation of caspase\u20108, resulting in cleavage and activation of downstream effector caspases, caspase\u20103 and caspase\u20107. Formation of this secondary complex is tightly regulated by the inducible caspase\u20108 inhibitor c\u2010FLIP (cellular FLICE\u2010inhibitor protein), which dictates the activity of caspase\u20108 and determines if apoptosis ensues. 13 If caspase\u20108 activity is compromised, TNF stimulation under appropriate circumstances, such as IAP depletion, triggers necroptosis ( Figure 1 ). TNF\u2010induced necroptosis requires the kinase activity of RIPK1 and RIPK3, and the RIPK3 substrate, the pseudokinase Mixed Lineage Kinase domain\u2010Like protein (MLKL). The phosphorylation of MLKL by RIPK3 activates MLKL, and is thought to result in a conformational change that leads to the exposure of the N\u2010terminal four\u2010helix bundle (4HB) killing domain. 14 , 15 , 16 In its oligomerised form, MLKL migrates to plasma membranes, where it is purported to cause death via pore formation, 17 thus leading to inflammatory DAMP release (for example, IL\u20101\u03b1 and HMGB1). In contrast to the cIAPs, X\u2010linked IAP (XIAP) has not yet been detected in the TNFRSC, but is widely reported to bind and directly inhibit apoptotic caspases, caspase\u20103, \u22127 and \u22129. Recently, however, XIAP has also been shown to critically regulate both cell death and innate immune responses following TNF and TLR ligation (discussed later in this review). Despite this fact, no major perturbation of TNF\u2010induced canonical NF\u2010\u03baB, p38 or JNK signalling pathways has been reported in XIAP\u2010deficient dendritic cells. 18 Nevertheless, inhibition of both the cIAPs and XIAP with compounds that mimic the natural inhibitor of IAPs, Smac/DIABLO, termed \u2018Smac mimetics\u2019, or the genetic loss of all three IAPs, leads to the formation of a complex akin to complex\u2010II, termed the \u2018ripoptosome\u2019, comprising RIPK1, RIPK3, FADD, caspase\u20108 and cFLIP. 19 , 20 This complex forms without the need for receptor ligation and functions to drive caspase\u20108\u2010mediated apoptosis or caspase\u2010independent necroptosis. Distinct from TNFR1, FAS and TRAIL\u2010RI and \u2010RII signalling culminates from the formation of a death inducing signalling complex (DISC) at the receptor cytoplasmic tail ( Figure 1 ). This DISC complex is remarkably similar to the TNFR complex\u2010II, and the ripoptosome, in that it forms from a DD interaction between the receptor and FADD, which is followed by death effector domain (DED)\u2010mediated recruitment, oligomerisation and activation of caspase\u20108 or \u221210. FasL and TRAIL receptors are considered classic examples of \u2018death receptors\u2019, as their primary function is to drive caspase activation and apoptosis, unlike TNFR1 whose primary role is to activate NF\u2010\u03baB to drive inflammatory gene transcription. However, recently it has been appreciated that FasL and TRAIL receptor engagement can lead to pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression. 21 , 22 , 23 Not surprisingly, this inflammatory programme is somewhat dependent on RIPK1, but more critically dependent on caspase\u20108. 21 A scaffolding function for caspase\u20108 seems likely, as inhibiting caspase activity does not suppress Fas\u2010mediated cytokine/chemokine expression or function. 21 Similar to complex\u2010II and the ripoptosome, cFLIP is also recruited to the DISC to determine the cellular fate. Although cFLIP s acts as a direct inhibitor of caspase\u20108, cFLIP L is incorporated into the DISC thereby preventing pro\u2010caspase\u20108 interdomain processing but facilitating non\u2010apoptotic caspase\u20108 cleavage of a limited number of substrates around the DISC. 24 , 25 Like TNFR1, FAS and TRAIL\u2010R signalling events are important for regulating pathogen clearance and immune responses, as well as for driving inflammatory disease via effects on cell viability and/or pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine and chemokine induction. 26 The critical role of Fas/FasL signalling in disease is highlighted by the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) that occurs in patients harbouring Fas/FasL mutations, and C57BL/6. Fas lpr and C57BL/6. FasL gld mice, respectively. 3 The best recognised non\u2010apoptotic functions for FADD and caspase\u20108 is the repression of necroptotic signalling, where inhibition of caspase\u20108 by pathogen/mammalian inhibitors (for example, CrmA, vICA and cFLIPs), 29 chemical inhibition (for example, ZVAD\u2010fmk), 28 , 30 or genetic loss, 31 promotes necroptosis upon death receptor or TLR signalling. The seminal studies performed by the laboratories of Mocarski and Green, and more recently Strasser, highlighted this fact when they rescued the embryonic lethality of caspase\u20108 knockout mice (embryonic day 10.5) by co\u2010deletion of the necroptotic regulator Ripk3 or Mlkl itself ( Table 1 ). 32 , 33 , 34 Ripk3 \u2212/\u2212 Caspase\u20108 \u2212/\u2212 and Mlkl \u2212/\u2212 Caspase\u20108 \u2212/\u2212 mice are born viable and healthy, although similar to mice lacking Fas/FasL they succumb to SLE\u2010like lymphoproliferative disease. 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 Not surprisingly, mice deficient in the caspase\u20108 adaptor FADD, 36 , 37 or c\u2010FLIP ( Cflar gene) 38 , 39 are also embryonic lethal. However, only Fadd \u2212/\u2212 mice are rescued by blockade of necroptotic activity via deletion of Ripk3 or Mlkl , 34 , 39 , 40 suggesting that in the absence of c\u2010FLIP, FADD\u2010caspase\u20108 homodimers induce lethal apoptotic signalling. Consistent with this, loss of Fadd in the Cflar \u2212/\u2212 Ripk3 \u2212/\u2212 mouse restores viability. 39 Interestingly, early embryonic lethality of Fadd \u2212/\u2212 and/or caspase\u20108 \u2212/\u2212 mice is driven by TNFR1 signalling, as RIPK1 or TNFR1 deficiency but not TRIF loss prolongs survival, although mice still exhibit perinatal lethality akin to Ripk1 \u2212/\u2212 mice ( Table 1 ). 28 , 41 , 42 , 43 The lethality in Ripk1 \u2010deficient mice is partially rescued by loss of MyD88, TRIF and/or TNFR1. 41 , 43 More importantly, loss of RIPK3 or MLKL also delays death, demonstrating a repressive role of RIPK1 on inflammatory necroptotic signalling. 41 , 43 Intriguingly, complete rescue of Ripk1 \u2212/\u2212 mice was only achieved by elimination of both necroptotic (that is, RIPK3) and apoptotic (that is, caspase\u20108 or FADD) machinery. 41 , 42 , 43 Caspase\u20108 has also been shown to repress necroptosis in a cell and tissue\u2010specific manner. In gut epithelial cells, caspase\u20108 maintains the gut integrity to microbial challenge by preventing lethal necroptotic cell death and epithelial cell shedding. 44 Likewise, caspase\u20108 expression in the skin prevents inflammatory necroptotic cell death. 45 In the haematopoietic system caspase\u20108 apoptotic activity is widely thought to restrict lymphocyte accumulation, where ALPS develops in caspase\u20108\u2010deficient or Fas\u2010deficient patients, as well as in T cell\u2010specific caspase\u20108 knockout mice, Fas\u2010, FasL\u2010 or membrane FasL\u2010deficient mice. 3 , 46 However, unexpectedly, NF\u2010\u03baB1 signalling has recently been shown to drive the lymphoproliferation in mice deficient in Fas. 47 Necroptosis has been suggested to contribute to the contraction of T cell responses, as cell death in caspase\u20108 deficient T cells upon T cell receptor ligation is prevented by RIPK1 kinase inhibition or RIPK3 co\u2010deletion. 48 However, recent reports in MLKL and caspase\u20108 deficient mice show subtle differences in a discrete subset of inflammatory genes, suggesting closer examination of non\u2010necroptotic activities of RIPK3 and RIPK1 is warranted. 34 Caspase\u20108 loss in mature myeloid cells (that is, dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils) also does not lead to spontaneous or TLR\u2010induced necroptotic cell death, 49 however, reduced levels of IAPs renders cells permissive to necroptosis. 50 How caspase\u20108 prevents necroptotic signalling is not fully understood, although the catalytic activity of caspase\u20108, rather than its autocatalytic processing, appears to be essential to block necroptosis. 32 Caspase\u20108\u2010mediated cleavage of RIPK1 and RIPK3 is widely believed to limit necroptotic signalling, where necroptosis activation requires oligomerisation of full length RIPK1 and RIPK3 via RHIM\u2010RHIM interactions to form an amyloid\u2010like fibril structure. 51 Indeed, overexpression of mutant RIPK1 and RIPK3 RHIMs blocked necroptosis, however, these RHIM mutations may also inhibit upstream RIPK1/3 kinase activity. Nevertheless, increased phosphorylated MLKL activity is associated with reduced caspase\u20108 levels and amyloid\u2010like RIPK1 and RIPK3 deposits in the cortical lesions found in the brains of multiple sclerosis patients. 52 The levels of the different cFLIP isoforms, and the interaction of these isoforms with caspase\u20108 at the DISC, have also been suggested to dictate ripoptosome stability, and thus influence apoptotic and necroptotic death signalling. For instance, low cFLIP L levels trigger caspase\u20108 oligomerisation and activation to induce apoptosis and inhibit necroptosis, whilst high levels block apoptotic activity. In the case of cFLIP s, caspase\u20108\u2010c\u2010FLIP s complexes inhibit apoptosis and induce necroptosis. 53 Finally, caspase\u20108 also cleaves the deubiquitylase CYLD (cylindromatosis), which is required to deubiquitylate and activate RIPK1\u2010mediated necroptosis in response to TNF, 54 thus potentially providing an alternative or additional mechanism for silencing necroptosis. Recently, TLR4\u2010TRIF\u2010caspase\u20108 signalling was also shown to cleave CYLD to limit autocrine TNF\u2010driven, type 1 IFN\u2010dependent necroptosis in macrophages. 55 Intriguingly, this work contrasts a similar study that suggested type 1 IFN induces necroptosis in the absence of TNFR1/2. 56 In response to TNFR and TLR ligation cytokine transcription can be activated in a RIPK1 and RIPK3 dependent manner. 57 , 58 , 59 Subsequent studies have sought to discern if caspase\u20108 also regulates transcription of inflammatory genes. Cuda et al. recently documented that deletion of caspase\u20108 in dendritic cells ( Caspase\u20108 CD11cCre ) is associated with heightened inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels and autoimmune SLE\u2010like disease, which is driven by RIPK1 and MyD88, but not RIPK3. 60 Myeloid\u2010specific loss of caspase\u20108 ( Caspase\u20108 LysMCre ) also led to mild autoimmunity, albeit with a less prominent inflammatory cytokine/chemokine profile that could be rescued by RIPK3 co\u2010deletion. 61 In line with in vivo findings, caspase\u20108 deficient macrophages exhibited altered transcriptional responses to TLR ligation in vitro , where enhanced TLR4\u2010induced TNF and IL\u20106 production was reduced by either necrostatin\u20101 or RIPK3 loss. 61 Unexpectedly, in vivo cytokine responses to LPS were blunted in Caspase\u20108 LysMCre mice, 61 akin to defective cytokine production reported in Ripk3 \u2212/\u2212 Caspase\u20108 \u2212/\u2212 , Mlkl \u2212/\u2212 Fadd \u2212/\u2212 and Ripk3 \u2212/\u2212 Fadd \u2212/\u2212 mice, and macrophages exposed to TLR3/4 stimuli or Gram\u2010negative bacteria (for example, Citrobacter rodentium ). 40 , 58 , 62 Results therefore suggest that caspase\u20108 is required for optimal TLR\u2010induced cytokine transcriptional responses. However, the fact there are conflicting reports as to whether defective canonical NF\u2010\u03baB activation is responsible for reduced cytokine production in Ripk3 \u2212/\u2212 Fadd \u2212/\u2212 , Mlkl \u2212/\u2212 Fadd \u2212/\u2212 and Ripk3 \u2212/\u2212 Caspase\u20108 \u2212/\u2212 macrophages to TLR ligation, 40 , 58 , 62 , 63 suggests that further studies are warranted. Globally, results point to an important role for caspase\u20108 levels in dictating TLR\u2010induced transcriptional responses in a cell\u2010by\u2010cell manner. Inflammasomes are large multimeric protein complexes that typically comprise a NOD\u2010like receptor (NLR), the adaptor ASC (apoptosis\u2010associated speck\u2010like proteins containing a CARD, encoded by the PYCARD gene) and caspase\u20101 ( Figure 2 ). The primary function of inflammasomes is to activate caspase\u20101 to cleave precursor IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u201018 into their mature bioactive forms. However, a physiological role for the lytic form of cell death, pyroptosis, which ensues following inflammasome activation has also been described. To date there are at least 6 NLR proteins suggested to form inflammasomes, NLRP1, NLRP3, NAIP/NLRC4 (IPAF), NLRP6, NLRP7, NLRP12, as well as non\u2010NLR inflammasomes, the HIN 200 family members AIM (Absent in melanoma)\u2010like receptors, AIM2 and IFI\u201016 (Interferon\u2010gamma inducible protein\u201016), and the tripartite motif\u2010containing family member Pyrin. 64 In addition to these canonical inflammasomes, caspase\u201011 (human orthologues caspase\u20104 and caspase\u20105) has recently been revealed to be the cytosolic receptor for intracellular LPS derived from Gram\u2010negative bacteria (for example, Burkholderia spp. and Eschericia coli .). 65 , 66 , 67 Termed the noncanonical inflammasome, LPS derived from Gram\u2010negative bacteria induces caspase\u201011 activation. Caspase\u201011, like caspase\u20101, cleaves gasdermin D to cause pore formation and pyroptotic cell death. However, caspase\u201011 also activates the NLRP3 inflammasome indirectly, reportedly as a result of gasdermin D\u2010mediated potassium (K + ) efflux. 67 , 68 Canonical inflammasome activation is generally thought of as a two\u2010step model. TLR/TNFR ligation provides the first signal, termed inflammasome priming, which is required for the transcriptional upregulation of inflammasome machinery (for example, NLRP3) and pro\u2010IL\u20101\u03b2. The second signal, the trigger, such as a PAMP (Pathogen associated molecular pattern) or DAMP, is then required to induce inflammasome assembly and activation in the cytosol ( Figure 2 ). A number of inflammasomes have well\u2010defined pathogen triggers that implicate them in innate immune responses to infection. NLRP1 senses lethal toxin from Bacillus anthracis , AIM2 senses cytosolic DNA, and pyrin is triggered by Rho GTPase inactivating bacterial toxins/effectors, such as Clostridium difficile toxin A/B. 69 , 70 In contrast, the most widely studied inflammasome, NLRP3, is triggered by a diverse range of PAMPs (for example, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus ), host\u2010derived DAMPs (for example, monosodium urate crystals, islet amyloid polypeptide and ATP), and environmental irritants (for example, silica and alum). 70 These diverse triggers implicate the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes, gout, and silicosis. 70 Yet the importance of tight regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL\u20101\u03b2 is best reflected by the potentially lethal autoinflammatory diseases, termed cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), which occur in humans and mice harbouring various activating mutations in NLRP3 . 71 Based on the diverse stimuli that trigger the NLRP3 inflammasome one might predict a unifying activation mechanism exists. Gabriel Nunez's laboratory proposed K + efflux as the universal trigger for NLRP3. 72 However, recent reports suggest that K + efflux is not required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation triggered by peptidoglycan\u2010N\u2010acetylglucosamine\u2010induced hexokinase release from the mitochondrial outer membrane, 73 or for caspase\u20108\u2010mediated activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in human monocytes. 74 Other common models for NLRP3 activation include phagolysosomal rupture and cathepsin release, ion channel flux and calcium influx, and reduced cyclic AMP. Activation of the mitochondrial cell death pathway is also postulated to trigger canonical NLRP3, via mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidised mitochondrial DNA release, or direct NLRP3 binding by the mitochondrial membrane lipid cardiolipin. 75 , 76 However, recent studies have genetically disputed the role of the mitochondria and associated proteins in canonical NLRP3 activation. 58 , 72 , 75 Hence, the elusive common NLRP3 activating mechanism remains of outstanding interest. Interest in caspase\u20108 as an inflammatory caspase stemmed from a study showing that TLR3 or TLR4 ligation and protein synthesis inhibition resulted in caspase\u20108 dependent activation and cleavage of precursor IL\u20101\u03b2 at the same site as caspase\u20101. 77 , 78 Subsequently, a range of stimuli have been shown to activate caspase\u20108 to cleave IL\u20101\u03b2 (and IL\u201018) in TLR or TNF primed cells ( Figure 3a ), where TLR4 ligation alone can trigger spontaneous caspase\u20108\u2010induced IL\u20101\u03b2 activation in bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). 79 Other stimuli include natural death receptors Fas 80 and DR3, 81 bacterial and fungal c\u2010type lectin receptor, dectin\u20101, 82 as well as chemicals that induce ER stress (for example, tunicamycin) 83 or chemotherapeutic compounds, such as doxorubicin, staurosporine 84 and histone deacetylase inhibitors ( Figure 3a ). 85 Fas\u2010mediated cleavage of IL\u20101\u03b2, draws parallels to the TLR\u2010mediated pathway in dendritic cells, as it too is dependent on FADD and caspase\u20108 and occurs independent of the NLRP3 inflammasome, however, it does not require RIPK3. 80 Interestingly, while Dectin\u20101 signalling can activate caspase\u20108 to cleave IL\u20101\u03b2 ( Figure 3a ), 82 other studies suggest that dectin receptors also utilise the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome. 86 , 87 How chemical stressors trigger apoptosis, caspase\u20108 and thus IL\u20101\u03b2 activation is unclear, but is likely to involve changes in expression of cell death inhibitory components. 84 In this regard, recent work shows that in LPS\u2010 or TNF\u2010 primed murine macrophages and dendritic cells, genetic or chemical loss of all three IAP proteins, and pivotally XIAP, can promote caspase\u20108\u2010mediated IL\u20101\u03b2 activation ( Figure 3b ). 18 , 50 , 78 Furthermore, loss of c\u2010FLIP enhances caspase\u20108 activation of IL\u20101\u03b2 secretion upon treatment with Smac mimetic, FasL or heat\u2010killed Candida albicans ( Figures 3a and b ). 88 A number of recent studies have also suggested that caspase\u20108 can activate NLRP3 ( Figure 3b ). For example, upon chemical or genetic loss of IAP activity in LPS\u2010primed murine macrophages and dendritic cells, TLR\u2010TRIF\u2010RIPK1\u2010RIPK3\u2010caspase\u20108 signalling has been shown to not only directly cleave IL\u20101\u03b2, but to also induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation, 18 , 50 , 78 independent of the kinase activity of RIPK1 and RIPK3. 50 In contrast, Gurung et al. suggested that FADD\u2010RIPK3\u2010caspase\u20108 associates with the NLRP3 inflammasome to promote canonical (for example, ATP and nigericin) and non\u2010canonical caspase\u201011 (for example, C. rodentium ) inflammasome activation. 62 However, as other groups have reported relatively normal canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation (for example, ASC oligomerisation and Caspase\u20101 cleavage) in Ripk3 \u2212/\u2212 Caspase\u20108 \u2212/\u2212 (and Caspase\u20108 \u2212/\u2212 ) myeloid cells upon sufficient priming signals, this finding warrants re\u2010examination. 49 , 50 , 89 A further model proposed in response to Yersinia infection is that a RIPK1\u2010FADD\u2010caspase\u20108 complex can directly cleave caspase\u20101 in the absence of NLRP3 and NLRC4. 63 , 90 Despite these variations, we recently established an upstream position for caspase\u20108 in ripoptosome\u2010mediated, but not canonical, NLRP3 inflammasome activation. 50 In this study, to avoid issues in defective priming in Ripk3 \u2212/\u2212 Caspase\u20108 \u2212/\u2212 macrophages, NLRP3 was triggered in unprimed macrophages (which express low levels of NLRP3) and caspase\u20101 cleavage assessed as an activation measurement. Upon Smac mimetic\u2010induced inhibition of IAPs, caspase\u20101 activity was blocked in Ripk3 \u2212/\u2212 Caspase\u20108 \u2212/\u2212 and Nlrp3 \u2212/\u2212 macrophages. In contrast, in response to canonical NLRP3 stimulus, nigericin, caspase\u20101 cleavage was only blocked in the absence of NLRP3 demonstrating that caspase\u20108 is not required for canonical inflammasome activation. 50 In bone marrow derived dendritic cells a TLR\u2010TRIF\u2010RIPK3 platform not only activates caspase\u20108 to directly cleave IL\u20101\u03b2, but also triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation. 79 Intriguingly this IL\u20101\u03b2 activation occurs largely in the absence of cell death, and independent of the kinase activities of RIPK1 and RIPK3. However, unexpectedly, a RIPK3 kinase inhibitor, which blocks necroptotic activity and amplifies caspase\u20108 activity, 91 actually heightened IL\u20101\u03b2 activation. 79 An alternative TLR\u2010TRIF\u2010RIPK1\u2010FADD\u2010caspase\u20108\u2010mediated, K + independent, route to NLRP3 inflammasome activation was also recently described in human BlaER1 monocytes. 74 Of note, ROS activity was suggested to be involved in ripoptosome\u2010triggered NLRP3 activation upon IAP loss in TLR\u2010primed macrophages. 78 Further studies are, therefore, needed to address how RIPK1\u2010RIPK3\u2010FADD\u2010caspase\u20108 complexes can trigger the NLRP3 inflammasome. Recent work has also documented that when caspase\u20108 levels are reduced TLR ligation can also trigger NLRP3 inflammasome activation via necroptotic activity ( Figure 3c ). Caspase\u20108 deficiency in dendritic cells sensitised mice to LPS\u2010induced lethality through RIPK3\u2010driven NLRP3 inflammasome activation. 49 Subsequently, TLR2/4 ligation in caspase\u20108 deficient murine bone marrow derived dendritic cells and macrophages, as well as human BalER1 monocytes, was shown to trigger necroptotic activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, in a RIPK1 and RIPK3 kinase\u2010dependent manner. 49 , 50 , 74 Likewise, in TLR\u2010primed macrophages IAP loss and inhibition/genetic loss of caspase\u20108 leads to RIPK3 kinase\u2010dependent MLKL\u2010driven activation of NLRP3. 50 It has been proposed that following TLR3 pathway activation, catalytically inactive caspase\u20108 (that is, by chemical inhibition) acts as a scaffold to recruit a FADD\u2010RIPK1\u2010RIPK3 complex that subsequently, via the kinase activity of RIPK3, triggers MLKL\u2010dependent NLRP3 inflammasome activation. 92 Supporting this idea is the fact that TLR3\u2010induced necroptotic activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome was not restored by complementing RIPK3 into Ripk3 \u2212/\u2212 Caspase\u20108 \u2212/\u2212 macrophages. 92 However, defective TLR3/4 induced inflammasome priming in Ripk3 \u2212/\u2212 Caspase\u20108 \u2212/\u2212 macrophages may complicate these findings. 58 Furthermore, the fact TLR\u2010induced RIPK3\u2010MLKL can trigger NLRP3 inflammasome activation upon genetic loss of caspase\u20108, or RIPK1, also suggests that a scaffolding function for caspase\u20108 and RIPK1 may only be relevant to dsRNA. 43 , 49 , 50 , 92 Biochemically and structurally, caspase\u20108 has been shown to interact via its DED domain with the PYD domain of inflammasome adaptor ASC, thereby making it plausible that multiple ASC\u2010containing inflammasomes utilise caspase\u20108 signalling. 93 , 94 Studies have shown that in the absence of caspase\u20101, canonical NLRP3 (for example, nigericin) and AIM2 (for example, Francisella tularensis and DNA) inflammasome activation can cause ASC\u2010induced caspase\u20108 oligomerisation into filamentous structures capable of inducing apoptosis. 93 , 94 , 95 Furthermore, in the absence of caspase\u20101/11, canonical NLRP3\u2010ASC activation of caspase\u20108 induces not only apoptosis but also IL\u20101\u03b2 activation in dendritic cells, albeit with delayed kinetics compared with caspase\u20101. 89 Notably, ASC\u2010caspase\u20108 triggered apoptosis may occur preferentially in wild type dendritic cells exposed to low concentrations of inflammasome stimuli. 94 Perhaps in this scenario, apoptotic cell death would be a preferable immunologically silent route for the cells demise. The strongest physiological evidence for an ASC\u2010caspase\u20108 containing inflammasome is the fact that Francisella tularensis activates a caspase\u20101 independent AIM2\u2010ASC inflammasome to drive IL\u201018\u2010dependent IFN\u2010\u03b3 production. 96 In the case of Salmonella infection, an NLRC4\u2010ASC\u2010caspase\u20108\u2010caspase\u20101 inflammasome has also been shown to induce pro\u2010IL\u20101\u03b2 via caspase\u20108 and pyroptosis via caspase\u20101 activity. 97 Overall it appears possible that ASC may recruit caspase\u20108 to trigger appropriate responses to a microbial insult. TNF receptor\u2010associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS; Table 2 ) was one of the first genetically defined autoinflammatory diseases. TRAPS occurs due to autosomal dominant mutations of the TNFR1 (TNFRS1A) gene and leads to a hereditary recurrent fever syndrome. Mechanistically, missense mutations in the first two cysteine rich domains of the TNFR1 extracellular domain, critical for receptor association and ligand binding, have been linked to aberrant folding and defective receptor shedding. Defective receptor expression reportedly leads to overexpression, aggregate formation in the endoplasmic reticulum and stress responses, as well as mitochondrial ROS production. 71 , 99 , 100 These events have been linked to constitutive TNFR1 signalling and pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine release. Even in a heterozygous state, TRAPS TNFR1\u2010mutant cells exhibit both spontaneous and sustained LPS\u2010induced MAPK activation, resulting in heightened cytokine production, including TNF, IL\u20106 and IL\u20101\u03b2. 100 How IL\u20101\u03b2 is activated in TRAPS patients remains unclear, yet like TNF inhibition, IL\u20101 blockade is also used therapeutically. Until recently the E3 ligase XIAP was cast as a direct inhibitor of caspase\u20103, \u22127 and \u22129. However, it has now become abundantly clear in monocyte, macrophages and dendritic cells that XIAP and its E3 ligase activity, has an obligatory role in repressing ripoptosome activation and consequently preventing cell death and IL\u20101\u03b2 activation. 18 , 50 , 78 Despite functional redundancy of individual IAPs, macrophages lacking XIAP, or XIAP and cIAP2, are sensitised to LPS/TNF\u2010induced RIPK3\u2010caspase\u20108\u2010mediated apoptosis, RIPK3\u2010MLKL\u2010mediated necroptosis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. 50 Of note, myeloid\u2010specific cIAP1 and cIAP2 loss did not sensitise macrophages to death in vitro or activate IL\u20101\u03b2, yet mice developed a severe TNF\u2010driven inflammatory arthritis. 50 In contrast, co\u2010deletion of XIAP with cIAP1 and cIAP2, or inhibition of all three IAPs and TLR/TNFR ligation, resulted in maximal ripoptosome\u2010mediated apoptotic and necroptotic signalling, and IL\u20101\u03b2 activation in myeloid cells ( Figure 3 ). 50 Remarkably, mice lacking all IAPs in myeloid cells exhibited multi\u2010organ inflammation and arthritis associated with heightened inflammatory cytokines, including IL\u20101\u03b2 and TNF. 50 , 101 The importance of XIAP in repressing inflammatory signalling in mice is of significant interest, as mutations in XIAP are commonly associated with inflammatory bowel disease, 102 and loss of function mutations in XIAP are found in X\u2010linked lymphoproliferative disease 2 (XLP2) patients. 103 XLP2, which is often associated with Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infection, results in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) in 60\u201390% of patients. 103 The characteristic macrophage hyperactivation is associated with elevated levels of the inflammasome\u2010caspase\u20101 (or caspase\u20108) substrate IL\u201018 and clinical features reminiscent of CAPS patients with NLRP3 activating mutations, and mice with myeloid\u2010specific IAP loss ( Table 2 ). 104 Hence XLP2 with HLH could be reclassified as an inflammasome\u2010driven autoinflammatory syndrome. LUBAC, comprised of HOIL\u20101, HOIP and SHARPIN, is responsible for linear ubiquitylation of RIPK1 and NEMO to allow efficient NF\u2010\u03baB activation. The importance of LUBAC for activating NF\u2010\u03baB signalling in both humans and mice has been demonstrated by blunted cytokine transcription in fibroblasts lacking HOIP, HOIL\u20101 or SHARPIN in response to TLR ligands, TNF and IL\u20101\u03b2. 9 , 105 , 106 In line with this, defects in CD40 ligand signalling have also been observed upon loss of HOIL\u20101, HOIP and SHARPIN in B cells. 9 , 105 , 106 In the myeloid compartment the role of LUBAC in inflammatory signalling is less clear. Similar to the responses seen in fibroblasts, TLR\u2010induced NF\u2010\u03baB activation and cytokine production is defective in dendritic cells and macrophages derived from Sharpin cpdm/cpdm mice. 105 , 107 , 108 However, in contrast, LPS or TNF\u2010induced NF\u2010\u03baB activation and cytokine transcription is normal in HOIL\u20101\u2010deficient macrophages, 98 although defective cytokine production has been described upon Listeria infection. 109 Surprisingly, HOIP or HOIL\u20101 mutations in humans triggers systemic autoinflammation, immunodeficiency and amylopectinosis ( Table 2 ). 105 , 106 Likewise, loss of SHARPIN in mice ( Sharpin cpdm/cpdm ) causes a TNF/TNFR1 and partly IL\u20101 driven spontaneous autoinflammatory disease featuring chronic proliferative dermatitis, splenomegaly, and liver inflammation. 9 , 110 In contrast, HOIL\u20101\u2010deficient mice do not exhibit spontaneous autoinflammation, although animals do develop amylopectin\u2010like deposits in the myocardium with age and exhibit immunodeficiency. 109 Of note, spontaneous inflammatory responses are triggered in HOIL\u20101\u2010deficient mice infected with chronic MHV68 and M. Tuberculosis . 109 Consistent with this, HOIL\u20101 \u2010 and HOIP \u2010deficient human monocytes display cytokine hyper\u2010production in response to IL\u20101\u03b2 or TNF, 105 , 106 and anti\u2010TNF therapy reduced clinical inflammation in a HOIL\u20101 deficient patient. 106 This contradictory role for LUBAC in autoinflammation highlights the fact that we do not fully appreciate the roles of these proteins on a cell\u2010by\u2010cell basis and in different disease settings. Epidermal\u2010specific caspase\u20108 or FADD loss causes necroptotic skin lesions. 45 , 111 Hence, it was somewhat surprising that the dermatitis featured in Sharpin cpdm/cpdm mice is driven by TNF\u2010induced keratinocyte apoptosis, as shown by the absence of lesions upon epidermal\u2010specific deletion of FADD (on a Ripk3 \u2212/\u2212 background) or heterozygous deletion of caspase\u20108, but not MLKL loss. 110 , 112 In contrast, other disease manifestations were driven by both apoptotic and necroptotic signalling. For example, MLKL deficiency prevented the leukocytosis, and partly rescued the liver pathology and splenomegaly, in Sharpin cpdm/cpdm mice. 110 Considering IL\u20101 is a pathogenic factor in skin lesion development in SHARPIN\u2010deficient mice, the mechanism behind IL\u20101\u03b2 activation was recently evaluated. Deficiency in NLRP3 or caspase\u20101/11 in Sharpin cpdm/cpdm mice delayed dermatological symptoms, however, whether NLRP3 inflammasome activity was restricted to keratinocytes versus macrophages remains unclear. 107 This is particularly puzzlingly, as LUBAC activity appears to be essential for inducing, rather than inhibiting, inflammasome activation in macrophages. HOIL\u20101, for example, has been implicated in the linear ubiquitiylation of ASC and assembly of ASC\u2010containing AIM2 and NLRP3 inflammasomes. 98 Although a further study suggested LUBAC component SHARPIN regulated canonical and noncanonical NLRP3 inflammasome priming (that is, pro\u2010IL\u20101\u03b2 and caspase\u201011), and not AIM2 activation. 107 These discrepancies suggest that inflammasome activation regulation by LUBAC requires further study. A20 is widely recognised for its ability to dampen TNF/TLR\u2010induced NF\u2010\u03baB signalling via the enzymatic removal of ubiquitin chains from RIPK1, TRAF6 and NEMO. In humans, A20 polymorphisms (reduced A20 protein) are associated with a range of inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Recently, inactivating germline mutations in A20 were also discovered to cause a Bechet's like autoinflammatory syndrome, now termed Haploinsufficiency of A20 (HA20). HA20 patients exhibit exaggerated NF\u2010\u03baB responses, constitutive NLRP3 activation and elevated serological inflammatory cytokines, including IL\u20101\u03b2. 113 Interestingly, deletion of A20 in mice causes early onset lethality due to spontaneous multi\u2010organ inflammation and severe cachexia caused by excessive TLR\u2010MyD88\u2010TRIF\u2010RIPK3 signalling, independent of TNF/TNFR1. 114 , 115 , 116 Impressively, cell/tissue\u2010specific A20 deletion also often recapitulates aspects of inflammatory diseases associated with A20 dysfunction. For example, myeloid\u2010specific deletion of A20 causes spontaneous inflammatory arthritis that is dependent on the NLRP3 inflammasome and the IL\u20101 receptor but not TNF. 117 These results largely parallel findings in myeloid\u2010specific IAP knockout mice, although IL\u20101\u03b2\u2010associated pathology was TNF\u2010dependent in these animals. 50 Similar to IAP deficient macrophages, TLR stimulation of A20\u2010deficient macrophages resulted in spontaneous IL\u20101\u03b2 activation that was dependent on RIPK3 and partially on NLRP3 inflammasome activation, whereby residual IL\u20101\u03b2 was presumably driven by direct cleavage by caspase\u20108. 50 , 117 How A20 restricts spontaneous TLR\u2010induced RIPK3 mediated NLRP3 activation is unclear. A20 is obviously important in restricting NF\u2010\u03baB transcription and therefore NLRP3 inflammasome priming. Furthermore, A20 reportedly acts downstream to impede NLRP3 signalling by cleaving K63\u2010linked ubiquitin chains from K133 of IL\u20101\u03b2 to limit IL\u20101\u03b2 processing and secretion. 118 Additionally, A20 has recently been shown to deubiquitylate RIPK3 on K5 to limit necrosome formation, 116 however, surprisingly in contrast to RIPK3 loss, MLKL deletion does not protect A20 knockout mice from lethality. 119 Perhaps RIPK3\u2010caspase\u20108 inflammatory signalling, rather than necroptotic signalling, drives disease in the absence of A20. The role of the ripoptosome and caspase\u20108 signalling in common inflammatory disease and IL\u20101 activation has been difficult to study due to the early onset embryonic lethality in caspase\u20108 deficient mice due to excessive necroptotic signalling. Tissue\u2010 and cell\u2010restricted deletion of caspase\u20108 has also been complicated by necroptotic inflammatory phenotypes ( Table 1 ) and the fact caspase\u20108 regulates cytokine transcription. In fact, loss of key cell death receptor signalling components commonly precipitates in early onset lethality, or increased morbidity due to severe inflammatory disease and tissue destruction ( Tables 1 and 2 ). However, utilising a range of knockout mice and inhibitors of core death machinery the role of the ripoptosome in inflammatory disease is becoming more clear (see Table 3 for recent examples and Khan et al. 27 ). The discovery that co\u2010deletion of caspase\u20108 and RIPK3 leads to the birth of viable and healthy animals has led to a greater understanding of the role of caspase\u20108 signalling has in disease. However, as Ripk3 \u2212/\u2212 Caspase\u20108 \u2212/\u2212 mice eventually develop lymphoproliferative disease (>12 weeks of age), and exhibit defects in TLR\u2010induced cytokine production (ie. pro\u2010IL\u20101\u03b2), results are still difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, caspase\u20108 cleavage of IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u201018, or activation of NLRP3 is likely to be of physiological relevance. For example, the IL\u20101\u03b2 dependent murine K/BxN serum transfer arthritis model has been reported to be caspase\u20101\u2010and MLKL independent, and is instead dependent on RIPK3 and caspase\u20108 for local and systemic IL\u20101\u03b2 secretion during the resolution phase of disease. 50 Results suggest that caspase\u20108 activity is required for optimal priming and may directly cleave IL\u20101\u03b2 in this model. The contribution of RIPK3 and necroptotic signalling to a range of diseases reportedly driven by necroptotic signalling was recently re\u2010examined by Newton et al. 119 Contradicting previous findings, no role for RIPK3 and necroptosis was observed in acute pancreatitis, brain injury (major cerebral artery occlusion and hypoxia\u2010induced cerebral oedema) or DSS colitis ( Table 3 ). 119 Differences in experimental procedures or the microbiome were suggested as plausible explanations for these discrepancies. In contrast, in kidney ischaemia\u2010reperfusion injury and TNF\u2010induced systemic inflammatory syndrome, both MLKL necroptotic and apoptotic caspase\u20108 signalling contributed to disease pathogenesis. 119 Of note, the strongest role for necroptosis in disease resides around work exploring the mechanism behind death, rather than NLRP3 activation, induced by viral pathogens (for example, CMV and vaccinia virus) or pore\u2010forming toxin producing bacteria (for example, Serratia marcescens ). 27 , 29 , 120 Collectively these results highlight that previous findings in RIPK3\u2010deficient mice suggesting pathological necroptotic signalling in disease need to be revisited utilising MLKL\u2010deficient mice. Moreover, they suggest that caspase\u20108 activity is more pivotal in driving inflammatory disease pathologies and IL\u20101\u03b2 than previously thought. This review summarises an extensive body of research, which suggests there is substantial crosstalk between innate PRR and cell death signalling pathways, and that caspase\u20108 levels dictate the net outcome. Caspase\u20108 activity is now recognised to critically suppress necroptosis, regulate cytokine transcription, and to act downstream of RIPK3 or inflammasome\u2010related ASC to induce apoptosis. More remarkably, caspase\u20108 levels have been shown to act as a rheostat for activation of IL\u20101\u03b2. Ripoptosome\u2010associated caspase\u20108 can either directly cleave IL\u20101\u03b2 or indirectly trigger the NLRP3 inflammasome, and when caspase\u20108 levels are low RIPK3\u2010MLKL necroptotic signalling can also trigger NLRP3. These findings have major ramifications for our understanding of innate immune cell responses during disease, where apoptotic or necroptotic cell death combined with IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u201018 activation could be beneficial for pathogen clearance. Moreover, identification of whether apoptotic versus necroptotic cell death pathways contribute to NLRP3 activation and/or IL\u20101\u03b2 activation in common inflammatory disease, and in rare autoinflammatory diseases caused by mutations in cell death regulators, is of major interest and will inform rationale therapeutic drug design.

The mechanisms underlying this ineffectiveness remain unclear. Here, we identified the action of neuronal activation in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) in modulating physical activity, food intake and body weight using leptin receptor mutant obese Zucker (Lepr(fa), ZF) and Koletsky (Lepr(fak), SHROB) rats. Ad lib-fed SHROB rats with locked running wheels became hyperphagic and gained body weight rapidly. These alterations were not ameliorated in ad lib-fed SHROB rats with voluntary access to running wheels, but the body weight of SHROB rats with running wheel access was significantly decreased when they were pair-fed to the amounts consumed by lean controls. Determinations of hypothalamic gene expression revealed that sedentary ad lib-fed SHROB rats had increased expression of neuropeptide Y (Npy) and decreased expression of pro-opiomelanocortin (Pomc) in the arcuate nucleus (ARC). Both ARC Npy and Pomc expression were further altered under running and pair-fed conditions, indicating that both genes are appropriately regulated in response to increased energy demands or alterations caused by running activity and food restriction. Strikingly, c-Fos immunohistochemistry revealed that while voluntary running activity elevated the number of c-Fos positive cells in the DMH (particularly in the ventral and caudal subregions) of intact rats, such activation was not observed in ZF rats. Using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of the designer receptors hM3D(Gq) in the ventral and caudal DMH of ZF rats, we found that chemogenetic stimulation of neurons in these DMH subregions via injection of the designer drug clozapine N-oxide (CNO) significantly increased their running activity and reduced their food intake and body weight. Together, these results demonstrate that activation of ventral and caudal DMH neurons promotes physical activity and decreases food intake and body weight and suggest that intact DMH neural signaling is likely crucial for exercise-induced reductions of food intake and body weight in obese rats lacking leptin receptors.", "text": "Obesity has become a public health problem and has been linked to various life-threatening diseases such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Regular physical exercise provides numerous health benefits and is one of the most important strategies for preventing obesity and lowering the risk of obesity-associated comorbidities. Notably, physical exercise improves weight loss and, when added to dietary control, becomes a key factor for success in long-term weight maintenance in previously overweight and obese individuals (Wing and Hill, 2001 ). Intense exercise reduces daily energy balance in adolescents with obesity by both increasing energy expenditure and decreasing food consumption (Thivel et al., 2013 ). Using rodent obesity models, we and other investigators have demonstrated an important role for physical exercise in the prevention or control of obesity. Voluntary access to running wheels or running activity ameliorates hyperphagia and obesity of Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats lacking cholecystokinin (CCK) 1 receptors (Bi et al., 2005 ); chronic exercise lowers the defended body weight and adiposity in diet-induced obese (DIO) rats (Levin and Dunn-Meynell, 2004 ); and voluntary exercise delays monogenetic obesity and overcomes reproductive dysfunction of melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) knockout mice (Irani et al., 2005 ). In contrast, physical exercise appears less effective in obese animals with a deficit in leptin signaling. Voluntary exercise has only minimal or no effect on obesity in leptin deficient ob/ob mice (Dubuc et al., 1984 ) or leptin receptor deficient Zucker fatty rats (Stern and Johnson, 1977 ). Thus, while physical exercise exerts a profound action in the control of obesity in some obesity models, it is unclear why physical exercise is ineffective in obese animals lacking leptin or leptin receptors. Leptin, a hormone produced in adipose tissue in mammals, acts as an adiposity feedback signal to affect brain\u2019s control of energy homeostasis (Cone, 2006 ; Morton et al., 2006 ; Gautron and Elmquist, 2011 ; Friedman, 2014 ). The hypothalamus plays a fundamental role in maintaining energy balance via regulating food intake and energy expenditure; leptin modulates these hypothalamic actions. Particularly, the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus contains two populations of leptin receptor-containing neurons: the orexigenic neurons releasing neuropeptide Y (NPY) and the endogenous melanocortin receptor antagonist agouti-related protein (AgRP; Mercer et al., 1996 ; Hahn et al., 1998 ) and the anorectic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons producing \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH; Cheung et al., 1997 ). Leptin inhibits NPY/AgRP neurons and activates POMC neurons (Morton et al., 2006 ; Gautron and Elmquist, 2011 ). Thus, elevation of leptin signaling causes decreased food intake and body weight loss, whereas decreased leptin signaling produces opposite effects (Morton et al., 2006 ; Gautron and Elmquist, 2011 ; Friedman, 2014 ). Based on this notion, one might expect that physical exercise promotes leptin\u2019s actions, leading to subsequent inhibitory effects on food intake and body weight. Paradoxically, Zachwieja et al. ( 1997 ) found that voluntary running exercise decreases adipose leptin mRNA and circulating leptin levels in both obese and lean rats. We have demonstrated that voluntary running activity normalizes food intake, body weight, and plasma glucose levels, as well as prevents elevated plasma leptin levels in OLETF rats (Bi et al., 2005 ). Intriguingly, others have reported that postweaning exercise produces prolonged increases in central leptin sensitivity and signaling in DIO rats (Patterson et al., 2009 ). Despite these observations, how hypothalamic leptin signaling contributes to the feeding and body weight effects of physical exercise remains unclear. Zucker fatty ( fa / fa , ZF) and spontaneously hypertensive obese Koletsky ( fa k / fa k , SHROB) rats are animal models of obesity, and both strains have mutant leptin receptor in the fatty allele ( Lepr(fa) and Lepr(fak) respectively), resulting in leptin signaling deficiency (Chua et al., 1996 ; Phillips et al., 1996 ; Takaya et al., 1996 ; Wu-Peng et al., 1997 ). In addition to the vascular disease phenotype in SHROB rats, both ZF and SHROB rats develop hyperphagia, obesity, hyperinsulinemia and hyperlipidemia (Argil\u00e9s, 1989 ; Ernsberger et al., 1999 ). In the present study, we sought to use these rat models to evaluate the potential role for leptin signaling in exercise-induced reductions of food intake and body weight. Animals had voluntary access to running wheels, and we examined the effects of running activity on food intake, body weight, and ARC Npy and Pomc mRNA expression. Since exercise affects mRNA expression of Npy and anorectic corticotropin-releasing factor ( Crf ) in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) of OLETF rats (Bi et al., 2005 ) and centrally administered leptin increases Crf mRNA expression in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of intact rats but not Zucker fatty rats (Schwartz et al., 1996 ), we also examined the effects of running activity on the expression of these genes. Furthermore, we used the immediate early gene product c-Fos as a marker of neuronal activation to explore exercise-induced neuronal activation in the brain. The designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD)-based chemogenetic tools provide unique approaches for the in vivo study of neuronal functions (Roth, 2016 ). Among G protein-coupled DREADDs, the hM3D(Gq) DREADD contains engineered human M3 muscarinic receptors and is typically used for neuronal excitation (Roth, 2016 ). This receptor can be activated by the selective designer drug clozapine N-oxide (CNO; Armbruster et al., 2007 ). Finally, we used the hM3D(Gq) DREADD to further determine a role for DMH neuronal activation in modulating physical activity, food intake and body weight. Male obese Koletsky ( Lepr(fak) , SHROB) rats and age-matched male lean control (CTL) rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratories, Inc., and were maintained individually in locked running wheel cages on a 12:12 h dark/light cycle (lights on at 06:00h) in a temperature-controlled colony room (22\u201324\u00b0C). All rats had ad lib access to 45-mg food pellets except where noted and water was always available. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Johns Hopkins University and were in accordance with the National Institute of Health\u2019s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. At the beginning of the experiment, four lean rats were maintained in locked running wheel cages with ad libitum access to food and served as a sedentary and normal intake control group (CTL-SED). Eight SHROB rats were divided into two groups ( n = 4): one sedentary group with locked running wheels (SHROB-SED) and the other with voluntary access to running wheels (SHROB-RW). Both groups of SHROB-SED and SHROB-RW rats had ad libitum access to food. Running activity and food intake were computer monitored for 24 h/days. Body weight was examined daily. Five weeks after access to running wheels, SHROB-RW rats were pair-fed to the amount and pattern of food that was consumed by CTL-SED rats, i.e., food intake of each pair fed animal was determined by a computerized feeding system that presented food pellets in the same amount and pattern as its \u201cyoked\u201d CTL-SED rat. As previously reported, we used this pair-feeding approach to distinguish feeding or energy expenditure effect on body weight loss in intact rats with voluntary access to running wheels (Zheng et al., 2016 ). Four weeks later, all rats were sacrificed between 09:00 and 11:00 h by decapitation under isoflurane inhalation anesthesia, and brains were removed and rapidly frozen in isopentane on dry ice for subsequent analyses of hypothalamic gene expression. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed for determinations of hypothalamic gene expression in SHROB rats ( n = 4 per group). Briefly, brains were sectioned via a cryostat at \u221220\u00b0C, three hypothalamic nuclei at the levels of the ARC, the DMH and the PVN were punched out, and saved in RNAlater solutions. Total RNA was extracted from each sample using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). Quantitative real time RT-PCR was conducted to determine levels of mRNA expression for Npy , Pomc and Crf by using the iScript one-step RT-PCR kit with SYBR Green (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) on iQ5 Multicolor Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). \u03b2-actin was used as an internal control for quantification of individual mRNA. The formula 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394CT was used to quantify relative mRNA expression levels. The first \u0394CT was calculated by comparing the Ct (threshold cycle) value of a target gene to an internal control in the sample. The second \u0394\u0394CT was the difference in \u0394CT between the treated and control samples. The final value of 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394CT was determined as the amount of target gene expression relative to the control group. A list of primer sets included: Npy forward primer, 5\u2019-agagatccagccctgagaca-3\u2019, and reverse primer, 5\u2019-aacgacaacaagggaaatgg-3\u2019; Pomc , forward primer, 5\u2019-tccatagacgtgtggagctg-3\u2019 and reverse primer, 5\u2019-acgtacttccggggattttc-3\u2019; Crf , forward primer, 5\u2019-agaagagagcgcccctaaac-3\u2019 and reverse primer, 5\u2019-atcagaatcggctgaggttg-3\u2019; and \u03b2-actin, forward primer, 5\u2019-tgtcaccaactgggacgata-3\u2019 and reverse primer, 5\u2019-ggatggctacgtacatggct-3\u2019. One additional cohort of 12 male Zucker fatty ( Lepr(fa) , ZF) rats was purchased from Charles River Laboratories, Incorporation (ZF rats were purchased because SHROB rats were not supplied) and maintained individually in locked running wheel cages with ad libitum access to water and standard rodent chow. After 1 week habituation, seven rats had voluntary access to running wheels (ZF-RW) and five sedentary rats remained in locked running wheels (ZF-SED). For the sake of economy, 10 age-matched male Sprague-Dawley rats served as lean control; half of them had voluntary access to running wheels (LEAN-RW) and the other half remained in locked running wheels as a sedentary control (LEAN-SED). To prevent feeding effect on c-Fos activation determination, chow was removed from the cages 2 h before running wheels were unlocked. Three and a half hours after running wheel access, at a time when running wheel activity promoted strong c-Fos activation based on our pilot study, rats were anesthetized with Euthasol (pentobarbital sodium and phenytoin, Delmarva Laboratories, Midlothian, VA, USA) and perfused transcardially with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS as previously described (Chen et al., 2008 ). Brains were removed and stored in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4\u00b0C for 6 h, and were then transferred to 25% sucrose for 48 h at 4\u00b0C for subsequent c-Fos immunoreactivity determinations. Brains from four groups of the rats (5 LEAN-SED, 5 LEAN-RW, 5 ZF-SED and 7 ZF-RW) were processed for c-Fos immunohistochemistry. As previously described (Chen et al., 2008 ), 40 \u03bcm coronal sections through the whole brain region were cut via a cryostat and saved in three series (one in three throughout the brain). A series of sections was processed with our standard c-Fos immunohistochemistry (Chen et al., 2008 ). c-Fos positive cells were identified using Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Briefly, sections were incubated in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 60 min, rinsed in PBS and preabsorbed with normal goat blocking serum in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min. They were then incubated in rabbit anti-c-Fos antiserum (1:20,000, Oncogene Science, San Diego, CA, USA) over two nights at room temperature. After six washes in PBS, sections were incubated in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 60 min, washed three times in PBS, followed by incubation in ABC reagent (avidin DH:biotinylated horseradish peroxidase H complex) for 30 min. Finally, sections were stained by incubation with 3,3\u2019-diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromagen and nickel enhancer (DAB substrate kit for peroxidase, Vector Laboratories). They were then mounted onto gelatin-coated slides, air dried, dehydrated in an ascending series of ethanol and coverslipped. The number of c-Fos positive cells was quantified in the following areas: the PVN, the DMH, the ARC, the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), the lateral hypothalamus (LH), the area postrema (AP) and the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) as well as the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) according to rat brain atlas (Paxinos and Watson, 2005 ). Images of sections were captured by digital camera (Retiga 2000R, QImaging, Burnaby, Canada) attached to Zeiss Axio Imager (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc., Thornwood, NY, USA). The area of interest was outlined based on cellular morphology and c-Fos positive cells were counted by the imaging program (ImageJ, National Institutes of Health, USA). Data for c-Fos activation in all areas were bilaterally assessed and were presented as the total number of c-Fos positive cells per section. A subset of 12 male obese ZF rats at 5 weeks of age were purchased and individually housed in locked running wheel cages with ad libitum access to water and standard rodent chow. Based on the results of exercise-induced c-Fos activation in the brain, the vector of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated DREADD AAV5-hSyn-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry (hM3D, 5.3 \u00d7 10 12 vg/ml, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA) was applied for stimulation of neurons in the DMH, primarily in the ventral and caudal subregions. At 6 weeks of age, rats were randomly assigned into to two groups: eight rats received bilateral DMH injections of hM3D and four rats received bilateral DMH injections of the empty vector control (CTL). Briefly, 0.2 \u03bcl/site (~1 \u00d7 10 9 particles/site) of the vector hM3D or CTL were injected into the DMH bilaterally with the following coordinates: 2.9 mm caudal to bregma, 0.4 mm lateral to midline and 8.7 mm ventral to skull surface (Paxinos and Watson, 2005 ; Chao et al., 2011 ). Each DMH injection was made with a glass micropipette (10\u201330 microns in tip size) via the Drummond Nanoject II Auto-Nanoliter Injector (Drummond scientific company, Broomall, PA, USA) and the injector remained in place for additional 5 min before removal. Following DMH injection, rats were returned to locked running wheel cages for postoperative recovery, were habituated to the intraperitoneal (ip) injection, and their body weights were measured daily. At 3 weeks following DMH injection, a feeding test was carried out to determine the effect of neuronal activation in the DMH on food intake. Food was removed from the cages 2 h before lights off. At 30 min before lights off, rats received ip saline or the designer drug CNO (1 mg/kg body weight, Tocris, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The dose of CNO for selectively activating DMH neurons via the hM3D(Gq) was based on previous reports (Armbruster et al., 2007 ; Roth, 2016 ) and our pilot study. Food was returned to the cages at lights off (30 min after ip injection) and food intake was measured at 2, 4 and 24 h from lights off. After 3-day recovery, rats received a second injection in a counterbalanced design. Likewise, 2, 4 and 24 h of food intake were determined in animals. After this feeding test (at 4 weeks following DMH injection), both hM3D rats and CTL rats received ip injection of CND (1 mg/kg body weight) daily. IP injection was made at 30 min before lights off. Running wheels were unlocked in both groups after the first injection. Running activity, food intake and body weight were recorded daily for 3 days. On day 4, rats received last injection and 3.5 h later, rats were perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde as described above, and brains were saved for subsequent verification of DMH DREADD injection. Briefly, 40 \u03bcm coronal sections throughout the hypothalamic region were cut via a cryostat and the sections with m-Cherry (red) fluorescence were examined on a Zeiss Axio Imager (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging). Data from 2 hM3D rats with incorrect injection were excluded from subsequent statistical analyses. All values are presented as means \u00b1 SEM. Data were analyzed by StatSoft Statistica-7 software. Data for body weight and food intake were analyzed using two-way repeated measures ANOVA (analysis of variance). Data for gene expression were analyzed using two-tailed Student t -test. Data for c-Fos positive cells were analyzed using two-tailed Student t -test. All ANOVA\u2019s were followed by pairwise multiple Fisher\u2019s LSD comparisons. P < 0.05 was considered as a statistically significant difference. During the initial 5-week period of ad lib feeding, SHROB rats with access to running wheels (SHROB-RW) run an average of 500\u20131200 revolutions daily (about 0.5\u20131.2 km/day) with the mean of 992 \u00b1 219 revolutions/day (Figure 1A ). However, this running activity did not affect food intake. As shown in Figure 1B , food intake was significantly increased in sedentary SHROB rats (SHROB-SED) by about 70% more than lean sedentary control rats (CTL-SED) over the 5 weeks ( F (1,6) = 119.59, P = 0.00003), whereas SHROB-RW rats consumed the same amount of food daily as SHROB-SED rats ( F (1,6) = 0.199, P = 0.671). Thus, SHROB-SED rats gained body weight rapidly compared to CTL-SED rats ( F (1,6) = 21.006, P = 0.004, Figure 1C ). Although SHROB-RW rats gained slightly less body weight in weeks 2 and 3 relative to SHROB-SED rats, the degree of difference in body weight was very small (about 5% less than SHROB-SED rats) and the body weights of SHROB-SED and SHROB-RW rats did not significantly differ ( F (1,6) = 0.006, P = 0.942, Figure 1C ). As a result, both groups of SHROB rats became significantly heavier, gaining about 30% more weight than CTL-SED rats by week 5 (Figure 1C ). These data indicate that voluntary running activity was ineffective in preventing hyperphagia and obesity in SHROB rats, suggesting that SHROB rats appear to have impaired feeding and body weight regulation in response to physical activity. To assess this impairment, we exploited a food restriction strategy to investigate the feeding effect on body weight gain in SHROB rats. Following 5 weeks of ad lib feeding, SHROB-RW rats were switched to a pair-feeding regimen in which they received food pellets in the same amount and pattern as their \u201cyoked\u201d CTL-SED rats via a computerized feeding system (Figure 1B ). Pair feeding promoted running activity in SHROB-RW rats. The running activity of pair-fed SHROB-RW rats was greatly increased from an average of 500\u20131200 revolutions/day in initial 5 weeks to 1600\u20133300 revolutions daily (1.6\u20133.3 km/day) in the four subsequent weeks with the mean of 2331 \u00b1 425 revolutions/day ( P = 0.049 vs. 992 \u00b1 219 revolutions/day in initial 5 weeks, Figure 1A ). As expected, pair-fed SHROB-RW rats consumed the same amount of food as their \u201cyoked\u201d CTL-SED rats (Figure 1B ). From week 5 to week 9, SHROB-SED rats remained hyperphagic and continued to gain more body weight (about 103 g), leading to 40% increase in body weight at week 9 compared to CTL-SED rats that gained only 48 g (Figure 1C ). Conversely, pair-fed SHROB-RW rats lost about 2 g of body weight in 4 weeks (Figure 1C ). As such, the body weight of pair-fed SHROB-RW rats was significantly decreased, being 26% lighter than that of SHROB-SED rats at week 9 ( P = 0.009) and down to the level that was no longer significantly different from that of CTL-SED rats ( P = 0.208, Figure 1C ). Thus, these data provide evidence that food restriction together with the resulting elevation of running activity prevented body weight gain in SHROB rats, but the specific portion of weight loss in SHROB-RW rats resulting from food restriction alone was unclear. At week 9, we evaluated hypothalamic gene expression in SHROB rats. Consistent with loss of functional leptin receptors in SHROB rats (Wu-Peng et al., 1997 ), SHROB-SED rats had a 54% reduction of Pomc mRNA expression ( P = 0.006) and a 2.7 fold increase in Npy mRNA expression in the ARC compared to CTL-SED rats ( P = 0.046, Figure 2A ). These alterations became even larger in pair-fed SHROB-RW rats. Levels of Pomc mRNA expression in the ARC of pair-fed SHROB-RW rats were down to 43% of those in SHROB-SED rats ( P = 0.04, Figure 2A ). ARC expression of Npy mRNA in pair-fed SHROB-RW rats was increased by 1.7 fold of SHROB-SED rats ( P = 0.031, Figure 2A ). Thus, both ARC Pomc and Npy expression remain appropriately regulated in response to increased energy demands derived from physical exercise and food restriction despite leptin signaling deficiency. Within the DMH, both Npy and Crf gene expression are regulated in response to running wheel access in lean intact and obese OLETF rats (Bi et al., 2005 ; Kawaguchi et al., 2005 ). We next assessed whether such regulation is altered in SHROB rats with leptin signaling deficiency. In contrast to ARC NPY, a lack of leptin receptors did not affect Npy mRNA expression in the DMH of SHROB-SED (Figure 2B ). Levels of DMH Npy expression did not differ between the two groups of SHROB-SED rats and CTL-SED rats (Figure 2B ). There was a 26% increase in Npy mRNA expression in the DMH of pair-fed SHROB-RW rats compared to SHROB-SED rats, but this increase did not reach a statistical significance ( P = 0.374, Figure 2B ). Likewise, Crf mRNA expression in the DMH was not significantly altered in SHROB-SED or pair-fed SHROB-RW rats compared to CTL-SED or SHROB-SED rats, respectively (Figure 2B ). Since centrally administered leptin increases Crf mRNA expression in the PVN of fasting rats (Schwartz et al., 1996 ), we examined Crf mRNA expression in the PVN of SHROB rats. The expression levels of Crf mRNA in the PVN did not significantly differ among the three groups of rats, indicating that neither leptin signaling deficiency nor running activity and food restriction alters PVN Crf gene expression (Figure 2C ). To explore brain regions that may contribute to impairments in exercise-induced reductions of food intake and body weight in obese animals with leptin signaling deficiency, we examined exercise-induced c-Fos activation throughout the entire brain in ZF rats with mutant leptin receptors using c-Fos immunohistochemistry. Lean rats with running wheel access run 480 \u00b1 118 revolutions in 3.5 h. This running activity produced c-Fos activation in both the hypothalamus and the extra-hypothalamic areas (Figure 3A ). The number of c-Fos positive cells was significantly increased in the PVN, DMH, CeA, AP and NTS ( P < 0.05), but not in the VMH, ARC and LH in LEAN-RW rats compared to LEAN-SED rats (Figure 3A ). In contrast, ZF rats with running wheel access were less active and they run 292 \u00b1 106 revolutions in 3.5 h; about 61% of the running activity of LEAN-RW rats. As a result, running wheel access induced significant c-Fos activation in the CeA, AP and NTS in ZF-RW rats as seen in LEAN-RW rats ( P < 0.05, Figure 3B ). However, exercise-induced elevation of c-Fos activation in the PVN of LEAN-RW rats was not observed in ZF-RW rats (Figure 3B ). There was a 39% increase in the number of c-Fos positive cells in the DMH of ZF-RW rats compared to ZF-SED rats, but this increase did not reach a statistical significance ( P = 0.184, Figure 3B ). Strikingly, within the DMH, exercise-induced c-Fos activation was widely distributed in LEAN-RW rats (Figure 4A ), remarkably in the ventral subregion and the caudal DMH (Figures 4B,C ), whereas the number of c-Fos positive cells was significantly reduced in the DMH of ZF-RW rats (Figure 4D ), particularly in the ventral and caudal DMH independently of levels of running activity (Figures 4E,F ). These data provide evidence suggesting that both the PVN and DMH are potential brain regions for mediating the feeding and body weight effects of physical exercise. Previous reports have shown that lesions of the PVN do not prevent anorectic effect of exercise (Rivest and Richard, 1990 ), but lesions of the DMH cause hypophagia as well as decreased running wheel activity (Bernardis, 1972 ). Based on these data and the present c-Fos activation results, we hypothesized that exercise-induced activation of neurons in the ventral and caudal subregions of the DMH mediates the effects of running activity on food intake and body weight. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether chemogenetic stimulation of neurons in the ventral and caudal DMH via DREADD would affect running activity, food intake and body weight. As shown in Figures 5A,B , the AAV vector hM3D successfully infected DMH neurons (red) in the ventral subregion (Figure 5A ) and its vicinity including the caudal DMH (Figure 5B ) as detected with the expression marker mCherry. At an initial feeding test, running wheels were locked. There was no significant difference in food intake between CTL and hM3D rats receiving ip saline (Figure 5C ), whereas ip injection of CNO resulted in significant decreases in food intake at 2, 4 and 24 h post-injection in hM3D rats compared to CTL rats (Figure 5C ). As a result, while CTL rats gained 11 g of body weight in 24 h following CNO treatment, hM3D rats lost 2 g of body weight (Figure 5D ). After this acute test, animals received ip CNO daily and had voluntary access to running wheels. We monitored their running activity, food intake and body weight for 3 days. As expected, CTL rats receiving ip CNO ran very few revolutions, remained hyperphagic and gained body weight rapidly (Figures 6A\u2013C ). In contrast, running activity was significantly increased in hM3D rats receiving ip CNO (Figure 6A ). This treatment also resulted in significant decreases in food intake ( F (1,7) = 24.603, P = 0.0016, Figure 6B ) and body weight gain ( F (1,8) = 14.773, P = 0.005) in hD3M rats over 3 days compared to CTL rats (Figure 6C ). Thus, these results provide support for the view that ventral and caudal DMH neurons contribute to the regulation of physical activity, food intake and body weight. We have assessed a role for physical exercise in preventing obesity in ZF and SHROB rats with leptin receptor deficiency. We demonstrated that although SHROB rats had access to running wheels, the resulting physical activity did not affect their food intake and body weight. They remained hyperphagic and obese as seen in sedentary counterparts. Food restriction elevated their running activity and together these resulted in a successful reduction of body weight down to a level that was not significantly different from that of lean control rats. Consistent with leptin signaling deficiency, sedentary rats had decreased Pomc and increased Npy mRNA expression in the ARC relative to lean control rats. Regardless of this deficiency, ARC Pomc and Npy expression remained appropriately regulated in response to increased energy demands or alterations caused by food restriction and running wheel access. Levels of mRNA expression for DMH Npy , DMH Crf and PVN Crf were not significantly affected in rats with leptin receptor-deficiency under either sedentary or food restriction and running conditions. Intriguingly, c-Fos immunoreactivity determinations revealed that running activity induced c-Fos activation in the PVN and DMH of intact rats, but such activation (particularly in the ventral and caudal DMH) was not observed in ZF rats with leptin receptor deficiency. Chemogenetic stimulation of neurons in the ventral and caudal DMH in ZF rats resulted in significant increases in running activity and decreases in food intake and body weight. Overall, these results provide evidence that loss of exercise-induced neuronal activation in the DMH, at least in part, contributes to the ineffectiveness of voluntary running activity on hyperphagia and obesity of rats with leptin receptor deficiency, indicating a vital role for DMH neural signaling in the modulation of physical activity, food intake and body weight. Physical exercise has long been recommended as an important non-pharmacologic intervention in preventing obesity and reducing the risk of obesity-associated comorbidities. We now acknowledge that physical exercise increases energy expenditure, leading to increases in fuel use in muscle, lipolysis in adipose tissue and fat catabolism in liver (Borer, 2003 ), but how food intake is modulated by exercise to affect body weight remains incompletely understood. Early study demonstrated that food intake is increased corresponding to exercise-induced increase in energy expenditure to maintain energy balance (Mayer et al., 1954 ). Later, growing evidence indicated that physical exercise can cause body weight loss or prevent obesity not only by increasing energy expenditure but also by reducing appetite and food intake (Levin and Dunn-Meynell, 2004 ; Bi et al., 2005 ; Irani et al., 2005 ; Thivel et al., 2013 ). For instance, voluntary running activity prevents hyperphagia and obesity of OLETF rats (Bi et al., 2005 ). However, physical exercise has minimal effects on obesity in animals with leptin signaling deficiency (Stern and Johnson, 1977 ; Dubuc et al., 1984 ). One explanation is that activity levels are low in these animals and such activity does not combust significant energy. The results from the present study provide compelling evidence that this ineffectiveness is because running activity did not prevent their hyperphagia. OLETF rats with access to running wheels run about 1 km/day at initial week and this running activity normalizes their hyperphagia (Bi et al., 2005 ). Although ad lib-fed SHROB rats had comparable running activities (1.2 km/day) to those of OLETF rats at initial week, SHROB rats remained hyperphagic and gained significant body weight as seen in sedentary counterparts. In fact, pair-fed SHROB-RW rats reduced their body weight significantly down to a level that was no longer significantly different from that of lean control rats. Thus, these results demonstrate that exercise-induced reduction of food intake is critical for the preventive effect of exercise on obesity in animals with leptin signaling deficiency. To determine the neural mechanism underlying the ineffectiveness of exercise on food intake and body weight in these animals, we examined hypothalamic expression of Npy , Pomc and Crf in SHROB rats. Within the ARC, leptin acts on NPY/AgRP and POMC neurons (down-regulates Npy/Agrp expression and up-regulates Pomc expression) to decrease food intake and body weight; a loss of leptin\u2019s actions causes increased orexigenic NPY/AgRP and decreased anorexigenic \u03b1MSH signals, leading to hyperphagia and obesity (Cone, 2006 ; Morton et al., 2006 ; Gautron and Elmquist, 2011 ; Friedman, 2014 ). Consistent with leptin signaling deficiency, sedentary SHROB rats had increased Npy and decreased Pomc mRNA expression in the ARC compared to lean control rats. Furthermore, although the body weight of pair-fed SHROB-RW rats became comparable to that of lean control rats, ARC expression of Npy and Pomc mRNA was not back to normal in pair-fed SHROB-RW rats. Levels of ARC Npy and Pomc expression were altered even greatly in pair-fed SHROB-RW rats with significantly increased Npy and decreased Pomc expression in the ARC compared to ad lib-fed sedentary SHROB rats. The pattern of changes is similar to the previous reports that voluntary exercise or food restriction results in increased Npy and decreased Pomc mRNA expression in the ARC (Zachwieja et al., 1997 ; Bi et al., 2003 , 2005 ; Kawaguchi et al., 2005 ). Thus, in response to increased energy demands caused by food restriction and physical exercise, ARC NPY/AgRP and POMC neural systems remain appropriately regulated in SHROB rats despite leptin signaling deficiency, suggesting that ARC NPY/AgRP and POMC neural systems act to counterbalance negative energy balance resulting from food restriction and/or physical exercise. There was a caveat that the present study did not assess the regulation of ARC Npy and Pomc expression in SHROB rats in response to food restriction or running activity respectively. Thus, a specific influence of food restriction or running activity on levels of ARC Npy and Pomc expression in pair-fed SHROB-RW rats is unclear, which merits further investigation. In addition to ARC NPY, prior work has demonstrated an important role for NPY in the DMH (particularly in the compact subregion) in the regulation of energy balance (Bi, 2013 ). NPY overexpression in the DMH contributes to hyperphagia and obesity of rats, whereas knockdown of DMH NPY ameliorates these alterations (Bi et al., 2001 ; Yang et al., 2009 ; Zheng et al., 2013 ; Kim and Bi, 2016 ). Importantly, voluntary exercise limits elevated expression of Npy in the DMH of OLETF rats (Bi et al., 2005 ) and acute exercise also lowers DMH NPY signaling in rats with exercise-induced anorexia (Zheng et al., 2016 ). In contrast to ARC NPY, DMH NPY neurons do not express leptin receptors and DMH Npy expression is not affected by changes of circulating leptin levels in rats (Bi et al., 2003 ). The present study showing no significant alterations in Npy mRNA expression in the DMH of sedentary SHROB rats provides additional support for the view that DMH NPY signaling is not under the control of leptin (Bi et al., 2003 ). Furthermore, consistent with reports that chronic food restriction and running wheel activity result in increased DMH Npy expression (Bi et al., 2003 ; Kawaguchi et al., 2005 ), we found a 26% non-significant increase in Npy mRNA expression in the DMH of pair-fed SHROB-RW rats, implying that NPY in the DMH of SHROB rats is likely regulated in response to increased energy demands as previously shown in intact rats (Bi et al., 2003 ; Kawaguchi et al., 2005 ). Our prior work has also shown that running wheel activity induces elevation of Crf mRNA expression in the DMH (particularly in the dorsal subregion) in both OLETF rats and lean Sprague-Dawley rats (Bi et al., 2005 ; Kawaguchi et al., 2005 ). We have suggested that this elevation contributes to a feeding inhibitory effect of acute physical exercise (Bi et al., 2005 ; Kawaguchi et al., 2005 ). The relationship between leptin and CRF in the DMH in the control of energy balance has yet to be determined. Using mouse models, investigators have revealed an action of leptin in the dorsal subregion of the DMH in the regulation of energy expenditure and thermogenesis, but not food intake (Dodd et al., 2014 ; Rezai-Zadeh et al., 2014 ). While CRF-expressing neurons are localized to the dorsal subregion of the DMH in rats (Kawaguchi et al., 2005 ), leptin receptor-expressing neurons are found primarily in the ventral subregion of the DMH in rats (Bi et al., 2003 ). These neuroanatomical results suggest that leptin does not appear to act on DMH CRF neurons to affect physical activity in rats. The present observation of no alterations in Crf mRNA expression in the DMH of sedentary SHROB rats provides support for this view. In addition, in contrast to exercise-induced elevation of Crf mRNA expression in the DMH of lean and OLETF rats (Bi et al., 2005 ), Crf mRNA expression in the DMH was unaffected in SHROB-RW rats. The reason for this non-effect is unclear. Lesions of the DMH result in hypophagia, hypoactivity and decreased body weight in rats (Bernardis, 1972 ; Bellinger and Bernardis, 2002 ), suggesting that while the main output of the DMH is orexigenic, the DMH (likely through other neurons) also plays an important role in the regulation of physical activity. As discussed above, NPY in the compact subregion serves as DMH orexigenic signal to modulate food intake and thermogenesis/energy expenditure (Bi et al., 2012 ; Bi, 2013 ). In contrast, the neural basis of DMH regulation of physical activity and body weight remains incompletely understood. We have found that CRF in the dorsal subregion of the DMH contributes to the effects of exercise on food intake and body weight in rats (Bi et al., 2005 ; Kawaguchi et al., 2005 ), but DMH CRF is unlikely affected by leptin. Recent mouse studies have shown that stimulation of leptin receptor-containing neurons in the dorsal subregion of the DMH promotes thermogenesis and locomotor activity to lower body weight, but does not alter food intake (Rezai-Zadeh et al., 2014 ), whereas activation of leptin receptor-containing neurons in the ventral subregion modulates feeding behavior (Garfield et al., 2016 ). In contrast to mice, leptin receptor-expressing neurons are found mainly in the ventral and caudal subregions of the DMH in rats (Elmquist et al., 1998 ; Bi et al., 2003 ), but a role for these neurons in energy balance regulation has yet to be established. In the present study, we have found exercise-induced c-Fos activation in the DMH (particularly in the ventral and caudal subregions) of intact rats, but not in ZF rats with leptin receptor deficiency. These data suggest that ZF rats have a deficit in exercise-induced activation of DMH neurons, leading to ineffectiveness of physical exercise on food intake and body weight. Based on the distribution of exercise-induced neuronal activation in the DMH as seen in rat DMH leptin expressing-neurons (Elmquist et al., 1998 ; Bi et al., 2003 ), we targeted neurons specifically in the ventral and caudal DMH in ZF rats via DREADD mediated stimulation. We found that chemogenetic stimulation of neurons in these DMH subregions of ZF rats significantly increased their running activity and decreased their food intake and body weight. Thus, these results provide evidence that ventral and caudal DMH neurons contribute to the action of the DMH in the regulation of physical activity and food intake, implying that leptin or other factors may act on these neurons to modulate physical activity, food intake and body weight. Lesions of the PVN do not prevent the anorectic effect of exercise (Rivest and Richard, 1990 ), indicating that the PVN is not linked to the feeding effect of exercise. Consistent with this view, Crf mRNA expression is not affected in the PVN of intact rats during the period in which running activity results in significant decreases in food intake and body weight (Kawaguchi et al., 2005 ). We now provide evidence that Crf mRNA expression in the PVN was also unchanged in pair-fed SHROB-RW rats with leptin signaling deficiency. Although physical activity affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Droste et al., 2003 ), in which PVN CRF acts as a positive regulator (Vale et al., 1981 ), a subsequent study demonstrated that activation of CRF neurons in the PVN is driven primarily by stress (Yanagita et al., 2007 ). While running activity did not significantly differ between the two groups of forced and spontaneous running rats, forced (stress-related) running, but not spontaneous running, resulted in significant increases in c-Fos activity in PVN CRF neurons (Yanagita et al., 2007 ). Our present study revealed a significant increase in running-induced c-Fos activation in the PVN in intact rats, but not in ZF rats. These results indicate that ZF rats also have a deficit in exercise-induced activation of PVN neurons, likely non-CRF neurons. The nature and function of these neurons merit further investigation. In summary, we report that rats with leptin receptor deficiency are hyperphagic and obese, and voluntary running activity does not prevent these disorders. As expected, rats with leptin receptor deficiency have increased expression of Npy and decreased expression of Pomc in the ARC, supporting their causal roles in hyperphagia and obesity. Despite these alterations, both ARC Npy and Pomc expression remain appropriately regulated in response to food restriction and running activity. Levels of PVN Crf , DMH Npy and DMH Crf expression are not affected in rats with leptin receptor deficiency. However, these rats have a primary deficit in exercise-induced neuronal activation in the PVN and DMH, particularly in the ventral and caudal subregions of the DMH. Activation of neurons in these DMH subregions promotes running activity and decreases food intake and body weight. These results suggest that intact DMH neural signaling is likely crucial for the preventive effects of physical exercise on hyperphagia and obesity in obese rats lacking leptin receptors, providing potential hypothalamic targets for modulating physical activity and food intake to combat obesity.

Among G protein-coupled <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DREADDs</entity>, the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">hM3D</entity>(Gq) <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DREADD</entity> contains engineered human <entity uuid=\"0c006990-37cb-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">M3</entity> muscarinic receptors and is typically used for neuronal excitation (Roth, 2016 ).

Finally, we used the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">hM3D</entity>(Gq) <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DREADD</entity> to further determine a role for <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> neuronal activation in modulating physical activity, food intake and body weight. Male <entity type=\"Disease\">obese</entity> Koletsky ( <entity uuid=\"06b41096-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Lepr</entity>(<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">fak</entity>) , SHROB) rats and age-matched male lean <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">control</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CTL</entity>) rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratories, <entity uuid=\"0140cb78-1468-43fa-9de4-29305524c42e\" type=\"Antibody\">Inc.</entity>, and were maintained individually in locked running wheel cages on a 12:12 h dark/light cycle (lights on at 06:00h) in a temperature-controlled colony room (22\u201324\u00b0C). All rats had ad lib access to 45-mg food pellets except where noted and <entity uuid=\"a15ef744-2280-4548-8b20-a51c42ed6615\" type=\"Chemical\">water</entity> was always available. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Johns Hopkins University and were in accordance with the National Institute of Health\u2019s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. At the beginning of the experiment, four lean rats were maintained in locked running wheel cages with ad libitum access to food and served as a sedentary and normal intake <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">control</entity> group (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CTL</entity>-SED). Eight SHROB rats were divided into two groups ( n = 4): one sedentary group with locked running wheels (SHROB-SED) and the other with voluntary access to running wheels (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">SHROB-RW</entity>). Both groups of SHROB-SED and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">SHROB-RW</entity> rats had ad libitum access to food. Running activity and food intake were computer monitored for 24 h/days. Body weight was examined daily. Five weeks after access to running wheels, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">SHROB-RW</entity> rats were pair-fed to the amount and pattern of food that was consumed by <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CTL</entity>-SED rats, i.e., food intake of each pair fed animal was determined by a computerized feeding system that presented food pellets in the same amount and pattern as its \u201cyoked\u201d <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CTL</entity>-SED rat. As previously reported, we used this pair-feeding approach to distinguish feeding or energy expenditure effect on body <entity uuid=\"f018a4e5-676e-4f4a-9d97-140671996393\" type=\"Disease\">weight loss</entity> in intact rats with voluntary access to running wheels (Zheng et al., 2016 ). Four weeks later, all rats were sacrificed between 09:00 and 11:00 h by decapitation under <entity uuid=\"e08c48c6-d111-11e5-94a7-005056be9332\" type=\"Dict_Chem\">isoflurane</entity> inhalation anesthesia, and brains were removed and rapidly frozen in <entity uuid=\"ac85a56a-d119-11e5-94a7-005056be9332\" type=\"Chemical\">isopentane</entity> on <entity type=\"Chemical\">dry ice</entity> for subsequent analyses of hypothalamic <entity uuid=\"5fe6bd1c-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">gene expression</entity>. Real-time <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RT-PCR</entity>) was performed for determinations of hypothalamic <entity uuid=\"5fe6bd1c-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">gene expression</entity> in SHROB rats ( n = 4 per group).

Total <entity type=\"ChemicalClass\">RNA</entity> was extracted from each sample using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). Quantitative real time <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RT-PCR</entity> was conducted to determine levels of mRNA expression for <entity uuid=\"70536cb8-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Npy</entity> , <entity uuid=\"a6242936-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Pomc</entity> and <entity uuid=\"4fb0ccae-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Crf</entity> by using the iScript one-step <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RT-PCR</entity> kit with SYBR Green (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, <entity uuid=\"31524fd8-37cb-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">CA</entity>, USA) on iQ5 Multicolor Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, <entity uuid=\"31524fd8-37cb-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">CA</entity>, USA). <entity uuid=\"da83e768-cbe9-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">\u03b2-actin</entity> was used as an internal <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">control</entity> for quantification of individual mRNA. The formula 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394CT was used to quantify relative mRNA expression levels. The first \u0394CT was calculated by comparing the Ct (threshold cycle) value of a target gene to an internal <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">control</entity> in the sample. The second \u0394\u0394CT was the difference in \u0394CT between the treated and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">control</entity> samples. The final value of 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394CT was determined as the amount of target <entity uuid=\"5fe6bd1c-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">gene expression</entity> relative to the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">control</entity> group.

One additional cohort of 12 male Zucker fatty ( <entity uuid=\"06b41096-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Lepr</entity>(fa) , ZF) rats was purchased from Charles River Laboratories, Incorporation (ZF rats were purchased because SHROB rats were not supplied) and maintained individually in locked running wheel cages with ad libitum access to <entity uuid=\"a15ef744-2280-4548-8b20-a51c42ed6615\" type=\"Chemical\">water</entity> and standard rodent chow. After 1 week <entity uuid=\"647bbc9c-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">habituation</entity>, seven rats had voluntary access to running wheels (ZF-RW) and five sedentary rats remained in locked running wheels (ZF-SED). For the sake of economy, 10 age-matched male Sprague-Dawley rats served as lean <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">control</entity>; half of them had voluntary access to running wheels (LEAN-RW) and the other half remained in locked running wheels as a sedentary <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">control</entity> (LEAN-SED). To prevent feeding effect on <entity uuid=\"99905d6c-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">c-Fos</entity> activation determination, chow was removed from the cages 2 h before running wheels were unlocked. Three and a half hours after running wheel access, at a time when running wheel activity promoted strong <entity uuid=\"99905d6c-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">c-Fos</entity> activation based on our pilot study, rats were anesthetized with Euthasol (<entity uuid=\"8c803f0d-8a76-4d76-b807-365f00135c6d\" type=\"Dict_Chem\">pentobarbital sodium</entity> and <entity uuid=\"c0d9bdda-d46f-11e6-b0bb-06cfce364161\" type=\"Dict_Chem\">phenytoin</entity>, Delmarva Laboratories, Midlothian, VA, USA) and perfused transcardially with <entity type=\"Chemical\">phosphate-buffered saline</entity> (<entity type=\"Chemical\">PBS</entity>, pH 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in <entity type=\"Chemical\">PBS</entity> as previously described (Chen et al., 2008 ).

Brains from four groups of the rats (5 LEAN-SED, 5 LEAN-RW, 5 ZF-SED and 7 ZF-RW) were processed for <entity uuid=\"99905d6c-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">c-Fos</entity> immunohistochemistry. As previously described (Chen et al., 2008 ), 40 \u03bcm coronal sections through the whole <entity uuid=\"77f7457c-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">brain</entity> region were cut via a cryostat and saved in three series (one in three throughout the <entity uuid=\"77f7457c-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">brain</entity>). A series of sections was processed with our standard <entity uuid=\"99905d6c-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">c-Fos</entity> immunohistochemistry (Chen et al., 2008 ). <entity uuid=\"99905d6c-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">c-Fos</entity> positive cells were identified using Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, <entity uuid=\"31524fd8-37cb-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">CA</entity>, USA). Briefly, sections were incubated in 0.3% <entity uuid=\"156642cf-80b6-48ca-aa28-4a892a686b83\" type=\"Chemical\">hydrogen peroxide</entity> for 60 min, rinsed in <entity type=\"Chemical\">PBS</entity> and preabsorbed with normal goat blocking serum in <entity type=\"Chemical\">PBS</entity> containing 0.1% <entity type=\"Chemical\">Triton X-100</entity> for 30 min. They were then incubated in rabbit anti-<entity uuid=\"99905d6c-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">c-Fos</entity> antiserum (1:20,000, Oncogene Science, San Diego, <entity uuid=\"31524fd8-37cb-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">CA</entity>, USA) over two nights at room temperature. After six washes in <entity type=\"Chemical\">PBS</entity>, sections were incubated in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 60 min, washed three times in <entity type=\"Chemical\">PBS</entity>, followed by incubation in ABC reagent (<entity type=\"GeneProtein\">avidin</entity> DH:biotinylated horseradish peroxidase H complex) for 30 min. Finally, sections were stained by incubation with <entity uuid=\"d4646830-d116-11e5-94a7-005056be9332\" type=\"Chemical\">3,3\u2019-diaminobenzidine</entity> (<entity uuid=\"d4646830-d116-11e5-94a7-005056be9332\" type=\"Chemical\">DAB</entity>) <entity type=\"Chemical\">chromagen</entity> and <entity uuid=\"ac5b5344-0031-4ad9-afcd-e371e45be212\" type=\"Chemical\">nickel</entity> enhancer (<entity uuid=\"d4646830-d116-11e5-94a7-005056be9332\" type=\"Chemical\">DAB</entity> substrate kit for peroxidase, Vector Laboratories). They were then mounted onto gelatin-coated slides, air dried, dehydrated in an ascending series of <entity uuid=\"fb99695c-d10f-11e5-94a7-005056be9332\" type=\"Chemical\">ethanol</entity> and coverslipped. The number of <entity uuid=\"99905d6c-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">c-Fos</entity> positive cells was quantified in the following areas: the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PVN</entity>, the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity>, the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ARC</entity>, the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ventromedial hypothalamus</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">VMH</entity>), the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">lateral hypothalamus</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">LH</entity>), the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">area postrema</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">AP</entity>) and the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">nucleus of the solitary tract</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">NTS</entity>) as well as the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">central nucleus of amygdala</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CeA</entity>) according to rat <entity uuid=\"77f7457c-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">brain</entity> atlas (Paxinos and Watson, 2005 ). Images of sections were captured by digital camera (Retiga 2000R, QImaging, Burnaby, Canada) attached to Zeiss Axio Imager (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, <entity uuid=\"0140cb78-1468-43fa-9de4-29305524c42e\" type=\"Antibody\">Inc.</entity>, Thornwood, NY, USA). The area of interest was outlined based on cellular morphology and <entity uuid=\"99905d6c-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">c-Fos</entity> positive cells were counted by the imaging program (ImageJ, National Institutes of Health, USA). Data for <entity uuid=\"99905d6c-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">c-Fos</entity> activation in all areas were bilaterally assessed and were presented as the total number of <entity uuid=\"99905d6c-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">c-Fos</entity> positive cells per section. A subset of 12 male <entity type=\"Disease\">obese</entity> ZF rats at 5 weeks of age were purchased and individually housed in locked running wheel cages with ad libitum access to <entity uuid=\"a15ef744-2280-4548-8b20-a51c42ed6615\" type=\"Chemical\">water</entity> and standard rodent chow. Based on the results of exercise-induced <entity uuid=\"99905d6c-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">c-Fos</entity> activation in the <entity uuid=\"77f7457c-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">brain</entity>, the vector of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">adeno-associated virus</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">AAV</entity>)-mediated <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DREADD</entity> <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">AAV5-hSyn-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">hM3D</entity>, 5.3 \u00d7 10 12 vg/ml, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA) was applied for stimulation of neurons in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity>, primarily in the ventral and caudal subregions. At 6 weeks of age, rats were randomly assigned into to two groups: eight rats received bilateral <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> injections of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">hM3D</entity> and four rats received bilateral <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> injections of the empty vector <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">control</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CTL</entity>). Briefly, 0.2 <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">\u03bcl/site</entity> (~1 \u00d7 10 9 <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">particles/site</entity>) of the vector <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">hM3D</entity> or <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CTL</entity> were injected into the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> bilaterally with the following coordinates: 2.9 mm caudal to bregma, 0.4 mm lateral to midline and 8.7 mm ventral to skull surface (Paxinos and Watson, 2005 ; Chao et al., 2011 ). Each <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> injection was made with a glass micropipette (10\u201330 microns in tip size) via the Drummond Nanoject II Auto-Nanoliter Injector (Drummond scientific company, Broomall, <entity uuid=\"326a5e38-37cb-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">PA</entity>, USA) and the injector remained in place for additional 5 min before removal. Following <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> injection, rats were returned to locked running wheel cages for postoperative recovery, were habituated to the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">intraperitoneal</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ip</entity>) injection, and their body weights were measured daily. At 3 weeks following <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> injection, a feeding test was carried out to determine the effect of neuronal activation in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> on food intake. Food was removed from the cages 2 h before lights off. At 30 min before lights off, rats received <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ip</entity> saline or the designer drug <entity uuid=\"47be814c-d114-11e5-94a7-005056be9332\" type=\"Chemical\">CNO</entity> (1 mg/kg body weight, Tocris, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The dose of <entity uuid=\"47be814c-d114-11e5-94a7-005056be9332\" type=\"Chemical\">CNO</entity> for selectively activating <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> neurons via the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">hM3D</entity>(Gq) was based on previous reports (Armbruster et al., 2007 ; Roth, 2016 ) and our pilot study. Food was returned to the cages at lights off (30 min after <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ip</entity> injection) and food intake was measured at 2, 4 and 24 h from lights off. After 3-day recovery, rats received a second injection in a counterbalanced design. Likewise, 2, 4 and 24 h of food intake were determined in animals. After this feeding test (at 4 weeks following <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> injection), both <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">hM3D</entity> rats and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CTL</entity> rats received <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ip</entity> injection of CND (1 mg/kg body weight) daily. <entity uuid=\"343bd84a-37cb-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">IP</entity> injection was made at 30 min before lights off. Running wheels were unlocked in both groups after the first injection. Running activity, food intake and body weight were recorded daily for 3 days. On day 4, rats received last injection and 3.5 h later, rats were perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde as described above, and brains were saved for subsequent verification of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DREADD</entity> injection. Briefly, 40 \u03bcm coronal sections throughout the hypothalamic region were cut via a cryostat and the sections with m-Cherry (red) fluorescence were examined on a Zeiss Axio Imager (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging). Data from 2 <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">hM3D</entity> rats with incorrect injection were excluded from subsequent statistical analyses. All values are presented as means \u00b1 SEM. Data were analyzed by StatSoft Statistica-7 software. Data for body weight and food intake were analyzed using two-way repeated measures <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ANOVA</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">analysis of variance</entity>). Data for <entity uuid=\"5fe6bd1c-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">gene expression</entity> were analyzed using two-tailed Student t -test. Data for <entity uuid=\"99905d6c-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">c-Fos</entity> positive cells were analyzed using two-tailed Student t -test. All <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ANOVA</entity>\u2019s were followed by pairwise multiple <entity uuid=\"308f2292-37cb-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">Fisher</entity>\u2019s <entity uuid=\"d7cac1f6-d10f-11e5-94a7-005056be9332\" type=\"Chemical\">LSD</entity> comparisons. P < 0.05 was considered as a statistically significant difference. During the initial 5-week period of ad lib feeding, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">SHROB rats with access to running wheels</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">SHROB-RW</entity>) run an average of 500\u20131200 revolutions daily (about 0.5\u20131.2 km/day) with the mean of 992 \u00b1 219 revolutions/day (Figure 1A ). However, this running activity did not affect food intake. As shown in Figure 1B , food intake was significantly increased in sedentary SHROB rats (SHROB-SED) by about 70% more than lean sedentary <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">control</entity> rats (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CTL</entity>-SED) over the 5 weeks ( F (1,6) = 119.59, P = 0.00003), whereas <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">SHROB-RW</entity> rats consumed the same amount of food daily as SHROB-SED rats ( F (1,6) = 0.199, P = 0.671). Thus, SHROB-SED rats gained body weight rapidly compared to <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CTL</entity>-SED rats ( F (1,6) = 21.006, P = 0.004, Figure 1C ). Although <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">SHROB-RW</entity> rats gained slightly less body weight in weeks 2 and 3 relative to SHROB-SED rats, the degree of difference in body weight was very small (about 5% less than SHROB-SED rats) and the body weights of SHROB-SED and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">SHROB-RW</entity> rats did not significantly differ ( F (1,6) = 0.006, P = 0.942, Figure 1C ). As a result, both groups of SHROB rats became significantly heavier, gaining about 30% more weight than <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CTL</entity>-SED rats by week 5 (Figure 1C ). These data indicate that voluntary running activity was ineffective in preventing <entity uuid=\"589a3e10-63ff-401b-a705-ff6a58a51edc\" type=\"Disease\">hyperphagia</entity> and <entity uuid=\"149b413a-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">obesity</entity> in SHROB rats, suggesting that SHROB rats appear to have impaired feeding and body weight regulation in response to physical activity. To assess this impairment, we exploited a food restriction strategy to investigate the feeding effect on body <entity type=\"Disease\">weight gain</entity> in SHROB rats. Following 5 weeks of ad lib feeding, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">SHROB-RW</entity> rats were switched to a pair-feeding regimen in which they received food pellets in the same amount and pattern as their \u201cyoked\u201d <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CTL</entity>-SED rats via a computerized feeding system (Figure 1B ). Pair feeding promoted running activity in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">SHROB-RW</entity> rats. The running activity of pair-fed <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">SHROB-RW</entity> rats was greatly increased from an average of 500\u20131200 revolutions/day in initial 5 weeks to 1600\u20133300 revolutions daily (1.6\u20133.3 km/day) in the four subsequent weeks with the mean of 2331 \u00b1 425 revolutions/day ( P = 0.049 vs. 992 \u00b1 219 revolutions/day in initial 5 weeks, Figure 1A ). As expected, pair-fed <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">SHROB-RW</entity> rats consumed the same amount of food as their \u201cyoked\u201d <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CTL</entity>-SED rats (Figure 1B ). From week 5 to week 9, SHROB-SED rats remained <entity type=\"Disease\">hyperphagic</entity> and continued to gain more body weight (about 103 g), leading to 40% increase in body weight at week 9 compared to <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CTL</entity>-SED rats that gained only 48 g (Figure 1C ). Conversely, pair-fed <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">SHROB-RW</entity> rats lost about 2 g of body weight in 4 weeks (Figure 1C ). As such, the body weight of pair-fed <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">SHROB-RW</entity> rats was significantly decreased, being 26% lighter than that of SHROB-SED rats at week 9 ( P = 0.009) and down to the level that was no longer significantly different from that of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CTL</entity>-SED rats ( P = 0.208, Figure 1C ). Thus, these data provide evidence that food restriction together with the resulting elevation of running activity prevented body <entity type=\"Disease\">weight gain</entity> in SHROB rats, but the specific portion of <entity uuid=\"f018a4e5-676e-4f4a-9d97-140671996393\" type=\"Disease\">weight loss</entity> in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">SHROB-RW</entity> rats resulting from food restriction alone was unclear. At week 9, we evaluated hypothalamic <entity uuid=\"5fe6bd1c-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">gene expression</entity> in SHROB rats. Consistent with loss of functional <entity uuid=\"069e102a-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin</entity> receptors in SHROB rats (Wu-Peng et al., 1997 ), SHROB-SED rats had a 54% reduction of <entity uuid=\"a6242936-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Pomc</entity> mRNA expression ( P = 0.006) and a 2.7 fold increase in <entity uuid=\"70536cb8-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Npy</entity> mRNA expression in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ARC</entity> compared to <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CTL</entity>-SED rats ( P = 0.046, Figure <entity uuid=\"fb7a8ab0-37ca-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">2A</entity> ). These alterations became even larger in pair-fed <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">SHROB-RW</entity> rats. Levels of <entity uuid=\"a6242936-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Pomc</entity> mRNA expression in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ARC</entity> of pair-fed <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">SHROB-RW</entity> rats were down to 43% of those in SHROB-SED rats ( P = 0.04, Figure <entity uuid=\"fb7a8ab0-37ca-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">2A</entity> ). <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ARC</entity> expression of <entity uuid=\"70536cb8-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Npy</entity> mRNA in pair-fed <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">SHROB-RW</entity> rats was increased by 1.7 fold of SHROB-SED rats ( P = 0.031, Figure <entity uuid=\"fb7a8ab0-37ca-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">2A</entity> ). Thus, both <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ARC</entity> <entity uuid=\"a6242936-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Pomc</entity> and <entity uuid=\"70536cb8-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Npy</entity> expression remain appropriately regulated in response to increased energy demands derived from physical exercise and food restriction despite <entity uuid=\"069e102a-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin</entity> <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> deficiency.

We next assessed whether such regulation is altered in SHROB rats with <entity uuid=\"069e102a-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin</entity> <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> deficiency. In contrast to <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ARC</entity> <entity uuid=\"70536cb8-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NPY</entity>, a lack of <entity uuid=\"069e102a-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin</entity> receptors did not affect <entity uuid=\"70536cb8-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Npy</entity> mRNA expression in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> of SHROB-SED (Figure 2B ). Levels of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> <entity uuid=\"70536cb8-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Npy</entity> expression did not differ between the two groups of SHROB-SED rats and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CTL</entity>-SED rats (Figure 2B ). There was a 26% increase in <entity uuid=\"70536cb8-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Npy</entity> mRNA expression in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> of pair-fed <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">SHROB-RW</entity> rats compared to SHROB-SED rats, but this increase did not reach a statistical significance ( P = 0.374, Figure 2B ). Likewise, <entity uuid=\"4fb0ccae-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Crf</entity> mRNA expression in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> was not significantly altered in SHROB-SED or pair-fed <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">SHROB-RW</entity> rats compared to <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CTL</entity>-SED or SHROB-SED rats, respectively (Figure 2B ). Since centrally administered <entity uuid=\"069e102a-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin</entity> increases <entity uuid=\"4fb0ccae-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Crf</entity> mRNA expression in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PVN</entity> of fasting rats (Schwartz et al., 1996 ), we examined <entity uuid=\"4fb0ccae-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Crf</entity> mRNA expression in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PVN</entity> of SHROB rats. The expression levels of <entity uuid=\"4fb0ccae-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Crf</entity> mRNA in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PVN</entity> did not significantly differ among the three groups of rats, indicating that neither <entity uuid=\"069e102a-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin</entity> <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> deficiency nor running activity and food restriction alters <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PVN</entity> <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">Crf gene</entity> expression (Figure 2C ). To explore <entity uuid=\"77f7457c-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">brain</entity> regions that may contribute to impairments in exercise-induced reductions of food intake and body weight in <entity type=\"Disease\">obese</entity> animals with <entity uuid=\"069e102a-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin</entity> <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> deficiency, we examined exercise-induced <entity uuid=\"99905d6c-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">c-Fos</entity> activation throughout the entire <entity uuid=\"77f7457c-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">brain</entity> in ZF rats with mutant <entity uuid=\"069e102a-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin</entity> receptors using <entity uuid=\"99905d6c-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">c-Fos</entity> immunohistochemistry. Lean rats with running wheel access run 480 \u00b1 118 revolutions in 3.5 h. This running activity produced <entity uuid=\"99905d6c-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">c-Fos</entity> activation in both the <entity uuid=\"7845d9c6-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">hypothalamus</entity> and the extra-hypothalamic areas (Figure 3A ). The number of <entity uuid=\"99905d6c-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">c-Fos</entity> positive cells was significantly increased in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PVN</entity>, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity>, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CeA</entity>, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">AP</entity> and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">NTS</entity> ( P < 0.05), but not in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">VMH</entity>, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ARC</entity> and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">LH</entity> in LEAN-RW rats compared to LEAN-SED rats (Figure 3A ). In contrast, ZF rats with running wheel access were less active and they run 292 \u00b1 106 revolutions in 3.5 h; about 61% of the running activity of LEAN-RW rats. As a result, running wheel access induced significant <entity uuid=\"99905d6c-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">c-Fos</entity> activation in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CeA</entity>, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">AP</entity> and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">NTS</entity> in ZF-RW rats as seen in LEAN-RW rats ( P < 0.05, Figure 3B ). However, exercise-induced elevation of <entity uuid=\"99905d6c-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">c-Fos</entity> activation in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PVN</entity> of LEAN-RW rats was not observed in ZF-RW rats (Figure 3B ). There was a 39% increase in the number of <entity uuid=\"99905d6c-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">c-Fos</entity> positive cells in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> of ZF-RW rats compared to ZF-SED rats, but this increase did not reach a statistical significance ( P = 0.184, Figure 3B ). Strikingly, within the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity>, exercise-induced <entity uuid=\"99905d6c-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">c-Fos</entity> activation was widely distributed in LEAN-RW rats (Figure 4A ), remarkably in the ventral subregion and the caudal <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> (Figures 4B,C ), whereas the number of <entity uuid=\"99905d6c-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">c-Fos</entity> positive cells was significantly reduced in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> of ZF-RW rats (Figure 4D ), particularly in the ventral and caudal <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> independently of levels of running activity (Figures 4E,F ). These data provide evidence suggesting that both the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PVN</entity> and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> are potential <entity uuid=\"77f7457c-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">brain</entity> regions for mediating the feeding and body weight effects of physical exercise. Previous reports have shown that lesions of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PVN</entity> do not prevent anorectic effect of exercise (Rivest and Richard, 1990 ), but lesions of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> cause hypophagia as well as decreased running wheel activity (Bernardis, 1972 ). Based on these data and the present <entity uuid=\"99905d6c-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">c-Fos</entity> activation results, we hypothesized that exercise-induced activation of neurons in the ventral and caudal subregions of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> mediates the effects of running activity on food intake and body weight. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether chemogenetic stimulation of neurons in the ventral and caudal <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> via <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DREADD</entity> would affect running activity, food intake and body weight. As shown in Figures 5A,B , the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">AAV</entity> vector <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">hM3D</entity> successfully infected <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> neurons (red) in the ventral subregion (Figure 5A ) and its vicinity including the caudal <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> (Figure 5B ) as detected with the expression marker mCherry. At an initial feeding test, running wheels were locked. There was no significant difference in food intake between <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CTL</entity> and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">hM3D</entity> rats receiving <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ip</entity> saline (Figure <entity uuid=\"0b93a738-e548-4582-aa4e-d23be561b09c\" type=\"CellLine\">5C</entity> ), whereas <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ip</entity> injection of <entity uuid=\"47be814c-d114-11e5-94a7-005056be9332\" type=\"Chemical\">CNO</entity> resulted in significant decreases in food intake at 2, 4 and 24 h post-injection in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">hM3D</entity> rats compared to <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CTL</entity> rats (Figure <entity uuid=\"0b93a738-e548-4582-aa4e-d23be561b09c\" type=\"CellLine\">5C</entity> ). As a result, while <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CTL</entity> rats gained 11 g of body weight in 24 h following <entity uuid=\"47be814c-d114-11e5-94a7-005056be9332\" type=\"Chemical\">CNO</entity> treatment, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">hM3D</entity> rats lost 2 g of body weight (Figure 5D ). After this acute test, animals received <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ip</entity> <entity uuid=\"47be814c-d114-11e5-94a7-005056be9332\" type=\"Chemical\">CNO</entity> daily and had voluntary access to running wheels. We monitored their running activity, food intake and body weight for 3 days. As expected, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CTL</entity> rats receiving <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ip</entity> <entity uuid=\"47be814c-d114-11e5-94a7-005056be9332\" type=\"Chemical\">CNO</entity> ran very few revolutions, remained <entity type=\"Disease\">hyperphagic</entity> and gained body weight rapidly (Figures 6A\u2013C ). In contrast, running activity was significantly increased in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">hM3D</entity> rats receiving <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ip</entity> <entity uuid=\"47be814c-d114-11e5-94a7-005056be9332\" type=\"Chemical\">CNO</entity> (Figure 6A ). This treatment also resulted in significant decreases in food intake ( F (1,7) = 24.603, P = 0.0016, Figure 6B ) and body <entity type=\"Disease\">weight gain</entity> ( F (1,8) = 14.773, P = 0.005) in hD3M rats over 3 days compared to <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CTL</entity> rats (Figure 6C ). Thus, these results provide support for the view that ventral and caudal <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> neurons contribute to the regulation of physical activity, food intake and body weight. We have assessed a role for physical exercise in preventing <entity uuid=\"149b413a-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">obesity</entity> in ZF and SHROB rats with <entity uuid=\"06b41096-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin receptor</entity> deficiency. We demonstrated that although SHROB rats had access to running wheels, the resulting physical activity did not affect their food intake and body weight. They remained <entity type=\"Disease\">hyperphagic</entity> and <entity type=\"Disease\">obese</entity> as seen in sedentary counterparts. Food restriction elevated their running activity and together these resulted in a successful reduction of body weight down to a level that was not significantly different from that of lean <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">control</entity> rats. Consistent with <entity uuid=\"069e102a-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin</entity> <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> deficiency, sedentary rats had decreased <entity uuid=\"a6242936-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Pomc</entity> and increased <entity uuid=\"70536cb8-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Npy</entity> mRNA expression in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ARC</entity> relative to lean <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">control</entity> rats. Regardless of this deficiency, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ARC</entity> <entity uuid=\"a6242936-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Pomc</entity> and <entity uuid=\"70536cb8-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Npy</entity> expression remained appropriately regulated in response to increased energy demands or alterations caused by food restriction and running wheel access. Levels of mRNA expression for <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> <entity uuid=\"70536cb8-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Npy</entity> , <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> <entity uuid=\"4fb0ccae-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Crf</entity> and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PVN</entity> <entity uuid=\"4fb0ccae-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Crf</entity> were not significantly affected in rats with <entity uuid=\"06b41096-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin receptor</entity>-deficiency under either sedentary or food restriction and running conditions. Intriguingly, <entity uuid=\"99905d6c-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">c-Fos</entity> immunoreactivity determinations revealed that running activity induced <entity uuid=\"99905d6c-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">c-Fos</entity> activation in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PVN</entity> and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> of intact rats, but such activation (particularly in the ventral and caudal <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity>) was not observed in ZF rats with <entity uuid=\"06b41096-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin receptor</entity> deficiency. Chemogenetic stimulation of neurons in the ventral and caudal <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> in ZF rats resulted in significant increases in running activity and decreases in food intake and body weight. Overall, these results provide evidence that loss of exercise-induced neuronal activation in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity>, at least in part, contributes to the ineffectiveness of voluntary running activity on <entity uuid=\"589a3e10-63ff-401b-a705-ff6a58a51edc\" type=\"Disease\">hyperphagia</entity> and <entity uuid=\"149b413a-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">obesity</entity> of rats with <entity uuid=\"06b41096-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin receptor</entity> deficiency, indicating a vital role for <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> neural <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> in the modulation of physical activity, food intake and body weight. Physical exercise has long been recommended as an important non-pharmacologic intervention in preventing <entity uuid=\"149b413a-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">obesity</entity> and reducing the risk of <entity uuid=\"149b413a-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">obesity</entity>-associated comorbidities. We now acknowledge that physical exercise increases energy expenditure, leading to increases in fuel use in muscle, <entity uuid=\"605a6050-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">lipolysis</entity> in <entity uuid=\"78016714-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">adipose tissue</entity> and <entity uuid=\"78016714-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">fat</entity> <entity uuid=\"5f774c84-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">catabolism</entity> in <entity uuid=\"785faf5e-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">liver</entity> (Borer, 2003 ), but how food intake is modulated by exercise to affect body weight remains incompletely understood. Early study demonstrated that food intake is increased corresponding to exercise-induced increase in energy expenditure to maintain energy balance (Mayer et al., 1954 ). Later, growing evidence indicated that physical exercise can cause body <entity uuid=\"f018a4e5-676e-4f4a-9d97-140671996393\" type=\"Disease\">weight loss</entity> or prevent <entity uuid=\"149b413a-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">obesity</entity> not only by increasing energy expenditure but also by reducing appetite and food intake (Levin and Dunn-Meynell, 2004 ; Bi et al., 2005 ; Irani et al., 2005 ; Thivel et al., 2013 ). For instance, voluntary running activity prevents <entity uuid=\"589a3e10-63ff-401b-a705-ff6a58a51edc\" type=\"Disease\">hyperphagia</entity> and <entity uuid=\"149b413a-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">obesity</entity> of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">OLETF</entity> rats (Bi et al., 2005 ). However, physical exercise has minimal effects on <entity uuid=\"149b413a-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">obesity</entity> in animals with <entity uuid=\"069e102a-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin</entity> <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> deficiency (Stern and Johnson, 1977 ; Dubuc et al., 1984 ). One explanation is that activity levels are low in these animals and such activity does not combust significant energy. The results from the present study provide compelling evidence that this ineffectiveness is because running activity did not prevent their <entity uuid=\"589a3e10-63ff-401b-a705-ff6a58a51edc\" type=\"Disease\">hyperphagia</entity>. <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">OLETF</entity> rats with access to running wheels run about 1 km/day at initial week and this running activity normalizes their <entity uuid=\"589a3e10-63ff-401b-a705-ff6a58a51edc\" type=\"Disease\">hyperphagia</entity> (Bi et al., 2005 ). Although ad lib-fed SHROB rats had comparable running activities (1.2 km/day) to those of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">OLETF</entity> rats at initial week, SHROB rats remained <entity type=\"Disease\">hyperphagic</entity> and gained significant body weight as seen in sedentary counterparts. In fact, pair-fed <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">SHROB-RW</entity> rats reduced their body weight significantly down to a level that was no longer significantly different from that of lean <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">control</entity> rats.

Furthermore, consistent with reports that chronic food restriction and running wheel activity result in increased <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> <entity uuid=\"70536cb8-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Npy</entity> expression (Bi et al., 2003 ; Kawaguchi et al., 2005 ), we found a 26% non-significant increase in <entity uuid=\"70536cb8-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Npy</entity> mRNA expression in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> of pair-fed <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">SHROB-RW</entity> rats, implying that <entity uuid=\"70536cb8-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NPY</entity> in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> of SHROB rats is likely regulated in response to increased energy demands as previously shown in intact rats (Bi et al., 2003 ; Kawaguchi et al., 2005 ). Our prior work has also shown that running wheel activity induces elevation of <entity uuid=\"4fb0ccae-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Crf</entity> mRNA expression in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> (particularly in the dorsal subregion) in both <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">OLETF</entity> rats and lean Sprague-Dawley rats (Bi et al., 2005 ; Kawaguchi et al., 2005 ). We have suggested that this elevation contributes to a feeding inhibitory effect of acute physical exercise (Bi et al., 2005 ; Kawaguchi et al., 2005 ). The relationship between <entity uuid=\"069e102a-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin</entity> and CRF in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">control</entity> of energy balance has yet to be determined. Using mouse models, investigators have revealed an action of <entity uuid=\"069e102a-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin</entity> in the dorsal subregion of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> in the regulation of energy expenditure and thermogenesis, but not food intake (Dodd et al., 2014 ; Rezai-Zadeh et al., 2014 ). While CRF-expressing neurons are localized to the dorsal subregion of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> in rats (Kawaguchi et al., 2005 ), <entity uuid=\"06b41096-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin receptor</entity>-expressing neurons are found primarily in the ventral subregion of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> in rats (Bi et al., 2003 ). These neuroanatomical results suggest that <entity uuid=\"069e102a-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin</entity> does not appear to act on <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> CRF neurons to affect physical activity in rats. The present observation of no alterations in <entity uuid=\"4fb0ccae-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Crf</entity> mRNA expression in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> of sedentary SHROB rats provides support for this view. In addition, in contrast to exercise-induced elevation of <entity uuid=\"4fb0ccae-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Crf</entity> mRNA expression in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> of lean and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">OLETF</entity> rats (Bi et al., 2005 ), <entity uuid=\"4fb0ccae-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Crf</entity> mRNA expression in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> was unaffected in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">SHROB-RW</entity> rats. The reason for this non-effect is unclear. Lesions of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> result in hypophagia, hypoactivity and decreased body weight in rats (Bernardis, 1972 ; Bellinger and Bernardis, 2002 ), suggesting that while the main output of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> is orexigenic, the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> (likely through other neurons) also plays an important role in the regulation of physical activity. As discussed above, <entity uuid=\"70536cb8-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NPY</entity> in the compact subregion serves as <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> orexigenic signal to modulate food intake and thermogenesis/energy expenditure (Bi et al., 2012 ; Bi, 2013 ). In contrast, the neural basis of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> regulation of physical activity and body weight remains incompletely understood. We have found that CRF in the dorsal subregion of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> contributes to the effects of exercise on food intake and body weight in rats (Bi et al., 2005 ; Kawaguchi et al., 2005 ), but <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> CRF is unlikely affected by <entity uuid=\"069e102a-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin</entity>. Recent mouse studies have shown that stimulation of <entity uuid=\"06b41096-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin receptor</entity>-containing neurons in the dorsal subregion of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> promotes thermogenesis and locomotor activity to lower body weight, but does not alter food intake (Rezai-Zadeh et al., 2014 ), whereas activation of <entity uuid=\"06b41096-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin receptor</entity>-containing neurons in the ventral subregion modulates <entity uuid=\"5f62d68c-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">feeding behavior</entity> (Garfield et al., 2016 ). In contrast to mice, <entity uuid=\"06b41096-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin receptor</entity>-expressing neurons are found mainly in the ventral and caudal subregions of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> in rats (Elmquist et al., 1998 ; Bi et al., 2003 ), but a role for these neurons in energy balance regulation has yet to be established. In the present study, we have found exercise-induced <entity uuid=\"99905d6c-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">c-Fos</entity> activation in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> (particularly in the ventral and caudal subregions) of intact rats, but not in ZF rats with <entity uuid=\"06b41096-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin receptor</entity> deficiency. These data suggest that ZF rats have a deficit in exercise-induced activation of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> neurons, leading to ineffectiveness of physical exercise on food intake and body weight. Based on the distribution of exercise-induced neuronal activation in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> as seen in rat <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> <entity uuid=\"069e102a-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin</entity> expressing-neurons (Elmquist et al., 1998 ; Bi et al., 2003 ), we targeted neurons specifically in the ventral and caudal <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> in ZF rats via <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DREADD</entity> mediated stimulation. We found that chemogenetic stimulation of neurons in these <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> subregions of ZF rats significantly increased their running activity and decreased their food intake and body weight. Thus, these results provide evidence that ventral and caudal <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> neurons contribute to the action of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> in the regulation of physical activity and food intake, implying that <entity uuid=\"069e102a-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin</entity> or other factors may act on these neurons to modulate physical activity, food intake and body weight. Lesions of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PVN</entity> do not prevent the anorectic effect of exercise (Rivest and Richard, 1990 ), indicating that the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PVN</entity> is not linked to the feeding effect of exercise. Consistent with this view, <entity uuid=\"4fb0ccae-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Crf</entity> mRNA expression is not affected in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PVN</entity> of intact rats during the period in which running activity results in significant decreases in food intake and body weight (Kawaguchi et al., 2005 ). We now provide evidence that <entity uuid=\"4fb0ccae-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Crf</entity> mRNA expression in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PVN</entity> was also unchanged in pair-fed <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">SHROB-RW</entity> rats with <entity uuid=\"069e102a-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin</entity> <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> deficiency. Although physical activity affects the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">HPA</entity>) axis (Droste et al., 2003 ), in which <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PVN</entity> CRF acts as a positive regulator (Vale et al., 1981 ), a subsequent study demonstrated that activation of CRF neurons in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PVN</entity> is driven primarily by stress (Yanagita et al., 2007 ). While running activity did not significantly differ between the two groups of forced and spontaneous running rats, forced (stress-related) running, but not spontaneous running, resulted in significant increases in <entity uuid=\"99905d6c-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">c-Fos</entity> activity in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PVN</entity> CRF neurons (Yanagita et al., 2007 ). Our present study revealed a significant increase in running-induced <entity uuid=\"99905d6c-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">c-Fos</entity> activation in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PVN</entity> in intact rats, but not in ZF rats. These results indicate that ZF rats also have a deficit in exercise-induced activation of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PVN</entity> neurons, likely non-CRF neurons. The nature and function of these neurons merit further investigation. In summary, we report that rats with <entity uuid=\"06b41096-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin receptor</entity> deficiency are <entity type=\"Disease\">hyperphagic</entity> and <entity type=\"Disease\">obese</entity>, and voluntary running activity does not prevent these disorders. As expected, rats with <entity uuid=\"06b41096-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin receptor</entity> deficiency have increased expression of <entity uuid=\"70536cb8-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Npy</entity> and decreased expression of <entity uuid=\"a6242936-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Pomc</entity> in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ARC</entity>, supporting their causal roles in <entity uuid=\"589a3e10-63ff-401b-a705-ff6a58a51edc\" type=\"Disease\">hyperphagia</entity> and <entity uuid=\"149b413a-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">obesity</entity>. Despite these alterations, both <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ARC</entity> <entity uuid=\"70536cb8-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Npy</entity> and <entity uuid=\"a6242936-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Pomc</entity> expression remain appropriately regulated in <entity uuid=\"61ac9234-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">response to food</entity> restriction and running activity. Levels of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PVN</entity> <entity uuid=\"4fb0ccae-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Crf</entity> , <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> <entity uuid=\"70536cb8-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Npy</entity> and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> <entity uuid=\"4fb0ccae-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Crf</entity> expression are not affected in rats with <entity uuid=\"06b41096-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">leptin receptor</entity> deficiency. However, these rats have a primary deficit in exercise-induced neuronal activation in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PVN</entity> and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity>, particularly in the ventral and caudal subregions of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity>. Activation of neurons in these <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">DMH</entity> subregions promotes running activity and decreases food intake and body weight.

Over the last two decades, thanks to the technological revolution in molecular biology, our understanding of cerebellar development has drastically changed. We are now going through an exceptional period in our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the complex development of the cerebellum. An understanding of cell specification regulated by the expression of region-specific combinations of transcription factors or proneural genes, and the formation of synaptic circuits, seems within reach. Ferdinando Rossi, a few months before his death, undertook the monumental task of writing a monograph on the spectacular advances in our understanding of cerebellar development achieved in the last 20\u00a0years. Sadly, Ferdinando died a few months after beginning his monograph. This consensus paper, based on Ferdinando\u2019s initial design, summarizes many of these advances and is dedicated to his memory. The review comprises 18 brief sections, ranging from the early molecular specification of the cerebellar anlage to its mature architecture and pathology. It also includes information on neurogenesis, mainly the specification and origins of neuronal and glial progenitors. An important part of the paper is devoted to Purkinje cells (PCs) as key neurons of the cerebellar cortex responsible for the proliferation of granule cells (GCs) and the establishment of \u201ccrude\u201d projection maps with extracerebellar afferent fibers. Finally, the biochemical heterogeneity of PCs allows for a cortical subdivision into distinct functional bands, a presumptive protomap for the development of circuit topography (see in [ 1 ]). In this context, the problem of synapse elimination in the process of refinement and stabilization of climbing fiber (CF) connections is also summarized. The description of morphogenetic regulatory processes at specific locations of the developing neural primordium has led to the concept of secondary organizers, which regulate the identity and regional polarity of neighboring neuroepithelial regions [ 2 ]. These organizers usually develop within the previously broadly regionalized neuroectoderm with defined genetic boundaries. Their subsequent activity refines local neural identities along the anteroposterior or dorsoventral axes, thus regionalizing the anterior neural plate and neural tube [ 3 , 4 ]. The isthmic constriction of the neural tube contains the isthmic organizer (IsO; Fig.\u00a0 1a ), which provides structural polarity to the adjoining regions and orchestrates the complex cellular diversity of the mesencephalon (rostrally) and the cerebellum (caudally; [ 5 , 6 ]; for reviews see [ 4 , 7 ]). Cerebellar development is dependent on IsO signaling [ 5 ]. The molecular nature of the signal has been identified as a member of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, FGF8, which is highly expressed in the most anterior hindbrain. Indeed, beads containing FGF8 protein mimic the activity of the IsO tissue when ectopically transplanted [ 8 ] (Fig. 1a ). The earliest molecular event in IsO specification is the differential expression in the neural plate of Otx2 and Gbx2. In the avian embryo at Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) stage 8 [ 9 ], an Otx2 and Gbx2 negative neuroepithelial gap separates these domains, but by HH9 they come to overlap across the prospective mid-hindbrain boundary [ 10 ]. Then, Fgf8 expression is activated (at HH9 in chick and at embryonic day (E) 8.5 in mice) at the interface of the OTX2- and GBX2-positive neuroepithelial domains. The co-expression of Otx2 and Gbx2 in the IsO territory essentially disappears by HH11\u201312 (chick) and E10 (mouse), and both domains become thereafter mutually excluded and complementary. The limit determined by Otx2 and Gbx2 marks the mid-hindbrain molecular boundary (MHB) [ 10 \u2013 13 ]. Secondarily, Lmx1b and Wnt1 are co-expressed in a thin band confined to the caudalmost Otx2 expression domain, abutting the Fgf8 domain at the most rostral edge of the hindbrain. Note that although early Fgf8 expression appears in the territory co-expressing Otx2 / Gbx2 , double deletion of these two genes encoding transcription factors does not primarily affect the activation of Fgf8 expression [ 13 , 14 ]. Other genes expressed at early stages across the prospective MHB, such as Pax - 2 and Iroquas ( Irxs ), seem also to be required for the expression of Otx2 , Gbx2 , and Fgf8 and the proper formation of the mesencephalic and rhombencephalic vesicles. Moreover, FGF8 signaling may act at the IsO in concert with other signaling molecules, such as WNT1, sonic hedgehog (SHH), and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 family members. The morphogenetic activity of the IsO is thus the consequence of the specific temporo-spatial expression of molecular signals that regulate the specification and structural development of mesencephalic and cerebellar neuroepithelial territories (Fig. 1b ). Alterations of Fgf8 and Gbx2 gene expression lead to massive disruption of the mid-hindbrain neural territory due to gene patterning deregulation [ 15 ]. A decreasing gradient of FGF8 protein concentration in the alar plate of the isthmus and rhombomere 1 (r1) is fundamental for cell survival and the differential development of cerebellar regions [ 7 , 16 , 17 ]. Finally, in the proposed mechanism by which FGF8 signaling spreads over a field of target cells, at least in zebrafish, patterning is established and maintained by two essential factors: first, the free diffusion of FGF8 molecules away from the secretion source through the extracellular space and secondly an absorptive function of the receiving cells regulated by FGF receptor-mediated endocytosis [ 18 ]; reviewed in [ 4 ]. The differential orientation and polarity of the FGF8 signal seems to be directly dependent on the spatial position of FGF8-related secondary organizers and on the activity of the negative modulators MKP3, SEF, and sprouty1/2 (SPRY1/2). FGF8 may also translocate into the nucleus, and this nuclear FGF8 may function as a transcriptional regulator to induce Spry2 in the isthmus independently of ERK phosphorylation. Similar findings in mouse showed that maintenance of the Spry2 expression pattern along the isthmic region occurs in the absence of both FGF8 in the extracellular compartment and ERK phosphorylation (reviewed in [ 4 ]). At E9, following territorial specification and the closure of the neural tube, murine cerebellar histogenesis begins with the specification of cerebellar progenitors. Several studies have demonstrated that all cerebellar cells are generated by the neuroepithelium of the alar plate of r1 [ 19 \u2013 22 ]. Conversely, the most dorsal region of r1 gives rise to the roof plate, which produces cells of the choroid plexus [ 23 ]. All cerebellar neurons are produced in the alar plate of r1 that is located rostrally adjacent to the isthmus. In this region, the dorsalmost part of the neuroepithelium gives rise to the roof plate while the ventrally and intermediately located parts become the ventricular zone (VZ) and the rhombic lip (RL). Recent genetic and viral lineage tracing studies have clarified the origins and birthdates of distinct subtypes of cerebellar neurons. Cerebellar glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons are generated from the RL and the VZ respectively. In mice, glutamatergic neurons in the cerebellar nuclei (CN) leave the cerebellar RL at early stages (E10.5\u201312.5) and GCs at middle to late stages (E13.5 onward) [ 24 \u2013 26 ]. Unipolar brush cells (UBCs) are known to emerge at relatively late developmental stages [ 27 ]. In mice, PCs are born at E10.5\u2013E13.5, GABAergic interneurons (INs) in the CN at E10.5\u2013E11.5, and Golgi cells at approximately E13.5\u2013postnatal (peak around E14\u2013E16) [ 28 \u2013 31 ]. Late-born GABAergic INs, including stellate and basket cells, derive from secondary precursors in the prospective white matter (PWM) at later stages (from E13 to P5 with a peak around birth) [ 32 , 33 ]. Thus, cerebellar neuronal subtypes depend on when and where they are generated from neural progenitors. This leads to the idea that cerebellar progenitors with their own spatial and temporal identities produce specific neuronal subtypes. Two basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins, ATHO1 (also called MATH1) and PTF1a, participate in the specification of the spatial identities of cerebellar progenitors. Atoh1 is expressed in the progenitors of the RL, and targeted Atoh1 disruption results in the loss of glutamatergic neurons in the cerebellum [ 24 \u2013 26 ]. On the other hand, Ptf1a is expressed in the VZ progenitors and Ptf1a deletion results in the loss of all cerebellar GABAergic neurons [ 34 , 35 ]. Furthermore, mis-expression of ATHO1 and PTF1a in the VZ and the RL results in the ectopic production of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, respectively [ 36 ]. These facts suggest that Atoh1 and Ptf1a confer the spatial identities of the RL and the VZ on cerebellar progenitors to produce glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, respectively. Atoh1 expression in the RL is regulated by TGF\u03b2 and Delta-Notch signaling [ 37 \u2013 41 ]. Ptf1a expression is influenced by SHH signals [ 42 ]. PTF1a and ATHO1 can downregulate each other\u2019s expression\u2014forced expression of Atoh1 suppresses Ptf1a and, conversely, forced expression of Ptf1a suppresses Atoh1 [ 36 , 43 ]. Consistent with this view, Atoh1 expression ectopically expands into the VZ in Ptf1a mutants [ 35 , 36 ]. However, ectopic Ptf1a expression is not observed in the RL of Atoh1 mutants [ 36 ], suggesting that PTF1a suppresses the expression of Atoh1 but the converse is not physiologically true in the cerebellar primordium. In contrast to the GABAergic neuron progenitors in the VZ, the machinery to specify cerebellar glutamatergic neuron subtypes remains elusive. However, even when glutamatergic neurons are ectopically produced from the VZ by ectopic expression of ATHO1, the generation of neuronal types follows the temporal schedule of the normal glutamatergic neurons derived from the RL [ 36 ]. This suggests that, as for GABAergic neuron progenitors, glutamatergic neuron progenitors in the RL may change their temporal identities from \u201cglutamatergic CN neuron-producing type\u201d to \u201cGC/UBC-producing type\u201d during development (Fig. 2 ). In the RL at late stages, some progenitors express either GC (PAX6) or UBC (TBR2) markers [ 27 ]. This suggests that GCs and UBCs may be produced from distinct progenitors in the RL, although some cells in the RL are found to express both markers (see also \u201c Unipolar brush cells \u201d section). Because the loss of the roof plate or targeted disruption of genes expressed in the roof plate affects the morphology and the nature of the RL [ 23 , 44 , 45 ], extrinsic factors from the roof plate may also play important roles to regulate the identities of glutamatergic neuron progenitors in the RL. Cerebellar GABAergic neurons can be categorized into two subtypes: PCs and Pax-2 + INs. Each subtype is generated from a distinct progenitor in the VZ:PC progenitors (PCPs) and Pax-2 + IN progenitors (PIPs). At the early stages, only a small number of PIPs are located in the rostralmost region of the VZ and a large number of PCPs occupy the remaining regions in the VZ. As development proceeds, PCPs gradually transit to become PIPs spreading from ventral to dorsal. This temporal identity transition of cerebellar GABAergic neuron progenitors from PCPs to PIPs is negatively regulated by Olig2 and positively by Gsx1 [ 46 ]. The VZ subregion containing PCPs is also characterized by the strong expression of E-cadherin and the cell surface marker Neph3, which is a direct downstream target gene of PTF1a [ 47 , 48 ]. Moreover, downstream of PTF1a, Neurogenin1 and Neurogenin2 are expressed in the VZ and implicated in cell-cycle control and PC development [ 49 , 50 ]. Expression of LHX1/LHX5 [ 23 , 51 ] and Corl2 [ 52 ], seen in the subventricular zone, indicates the commitment of VZ-born daughter cells to a PC fate, and these markers are useful for assessing the differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived PCs [ 53 ]. Based on the birthdates of distinct PAX-2 + INs, PIPs may first produce GABAergic INs in the CN (from ~E10.5) and then generate Golgi cells (from ~E13.5; Fig. 2 ). At later stages of neurogenesis, PIPs may give rise to precursors in the PWM that eventually generate the stellate and basket cells. During cerebellar development, granule cell progenitors (GCPs) arise in the RL and undergo a prolonged clonal expansion that generates a population of granule neurons that outnumbers the total neuronal population of the cerebral cortex. Between E12.5 and E16, RL-derived precursors spread across the dorsal surface of the cerebellar anlagen to form the external granular layer (EGL) [ 54 ]. At this stage, RL-derived progenitors express the bHLH transcription factor gene Atoh1 [ 25 , 26 , 55 ], the zinc finger protein genes Zic1 and Zic3 [ 56 ], the homeobox gene Meis1 [ 51 ], the paired box gene 6 Pax6 [ 57 ], and the calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase 1C gene ( Pde1c ) [ 58 ] (Fig. 3 ). Atoh1 expression is induced by BMP signaling in the choroid plexus and the roof plate [ 55 , 59 ] and maintained by the roof plate organizer [ 41 ]. While the vast majority of ATOH1 + RL derivatives generate GCPs that migrate tangentially in the EGL, fate mapping experiments indicate that a subpopulation migrates rostrally to the nascent CN [ 25 , 26 , 51 , 60 ] (see \u201c Development of the Cerebellar Nuclei \u201d section below). Recent studies demonstrate that FGF signaling allocates discrete subpopulations of RL-derived ATOH1 + cells, with downregulation of FGF signaling being required to generate RL-derived cerebellar neurons [ 61 ]. During the early postnatal period, multiple mitogenic pathways expand the EGL from a thin layer to a layer six to eight cells deep. SHH provided by PC neurons is a major driver of GCP proliferation [ 62 ]. Molecular genetic studies demonstrate that ATHO1 [ 24 ] and MYCN [ 63 ] are required for GC specification and the expansion of the pool of GCPs in the early postnatal period. The importance of Shh to cerebellar histogenesis is underscored by elegant genetic analyses demonstrating that levels of SHH signaling control the foliation patterning of the cerebellar cortex [ 64 ] (see \u201c Cerebellar Foliation \u201d section), and studies on human medulloblastoma (MB) implicate defects in SHH signaling in MB formation (reviewed in [ 65 ], see \u201c Deregulated Developmental Pathways in Medulloblastoma \u201d section). The Notch2 pathway also stimulates the expansion of GCPs during cerebellar development as treatment of GCPs with jagged 1 (JAG1), a ligand of Notch2, markedly stimulates GCP proliferation and inhibits GC differentiation [ 66 ]. Genetic studies demonstrate that one mechanism for the action of activated NOTCH2 involves antagonizing BMP signaling [ 67 ] and upregulating Atoh1 expression [ 40 ]. Support for these key steps in GCP neurogenesis comes from the differentiation of mES cells into GCPs by stepwise treatment with morphogens that establish the cerebellar territory (WNT1, FGF8) [ 68 ], followed by BMPs that specify a GCP identity [ 55 ]. Subsequent treatment with SHH and JAG1 expands the ES-derived GCPs and exposure to BDNF supports terminal differentiation [ 68 ]. Recent gene expression studies using ES cells that express a NeuroD1 translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) tag to facilitate purification of GCP RNA show that the transcriptome of ES-derived GCPs generated by this approach approximates that of P7 GCs (Zhu, Tamayo, Mesirov, and Hatten, unpublished results). Following clonal expansion in the EGL, GCPs exit the cell cycle, downregulating ATOH1 and upregulating NeuroD1 [ 69 ], which is required for GCP differentiation [ 70 ]. Several pathways are thought to provide negative regulation of GCP proliferation, including BMP4, WNT3, and the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C Cdh1 ) ubiquitin ligase. WNT3 suppresses GCP growth through a non-canonical WNT signaling pathway, activating prototypic mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), the RAS-dependent extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) and ERK5, instead of the classical \u03b2-catenin pathway [ 71 ]. WNT3 inhibits GCP proliferation by downregulating proliferative target genes of the mitogen SHH and the bHLH transcription factor ATHO1 [ 71 ]. CK1\u03b4 is another novel regulator of GCP expansion as a loss of Ck1\u03b4 or treatment of GCPs with a highly selective small molecule CK1\u03b4 inhibitor inhibits GCP expansion. CK1\u03b4 is targeted for proteolysis via APC/C Cdh1 ubiquitin ligase, and conditional deletion of the APC/C Cdh1 activator, Cdh1 , in cerebellar GCPs results in higher levels of CK1\u03b4, suggesting an important role for the APC/C Cdh1 complex in GCP cell cycle exit [ 72 ]. Postmitotic GCPs express the axonal glycoprotein TAG1 (CNT2), a contactin-related adhesion molecule [ 73 , 74 ], which functions in parallel fiber (PF) extension. Genetic experiments show Semaphorin 6A (Sema6A) functions in the switch from tangential migration in the EGL to radial migration along Bergmann glia (BG) [ 75 ] by a mechanism that involves binding to Plexin A2 [ 76 ]. Recent live imaging and functional studies also demonstrate a critical role for the SIAH E3 ubiquitin ligase, which controls proteosomal degradation the Pard3A polarity protein and regulates GCP adhesion during EGL exit via the junctional adhesion molecule JAM-C [ 77 ]. During PF extension, the cell soma extends a leading process along the radial BG fiber [ 78 ]. Live imaging experiments demonstrate that migrating GCPs form an extensive adhesion junction beneath the cell surface involving the neuron-glial adhesion protein ASTN1 [ 79 \u2013 82 ] and extend a leading process with short filopodia and lamellipodia that enwrap the glial fiber [ 83 , 84 ]. Forward movement of the cell soma follows the release of the neuron-glial adhesion junction beneath the cell body, after which the neuron glides along the glial fiber until a new adhesion forms [ 84 ]. Live imaging functional studies show that the PAR6 polarity complex localizes to the centrosome and coordinates the forward movement of the centrosome and soma [ 85 ] by a mechanism that includes activation of actomyosin contractile motors in the proximal region of the leading process [ 86 ]. These studies suggest a model by which actomyosin contractility in the leading process, rather than in a classical \u201cleading edge\u201d at the tip of the leading process, provides the force needed for forward movement. Postmigratory GCs settle in the nascent granular layer (GL) where they extend dendrites and form synapses with mossy fiber afferent axons (inter alia). GCs relay and process neural inputs into the cerebellum from mossy fiber afferents to PC efferents. Each GC dendrite apparently synapses with a single mossy fiber, which has the capacity to promote combinatorial encoding and the enhanced processing of sensory input to the cerebellum [ 87 ]. The developmental regulation of GC dendrite/synapse formation is therefore central to cerebellar circuitry. Studies of dendrite-related timing mechanisms in GCs initially focused on the Gabra6 gene encoding the GABA A receptor \u03b16 subunit, which exhibits delayed or \u201clate\u201d gene expression in maturing GCs [ 88 ]. These and related studies revealed that the Nuclear Factor One (NFI) transcription factor family, and in particular NFIA, is important for dendrite formation and Gabra6 expression in maturing GCs [ 88 \u2013 90 ]. Further, while NFI proteins are constitutively expressed in the nucleus throughout GC maturation, the occupancy of an essential NFI binding site within the Gabra6 promoter closely mirrors the temporal onset of Gabra6 expression [ 88 ]. These studies directly implicated NFI occupancy as a timing mechanism for Gabra6 expression. What regulates NFI temporal binding to the Gabra6 gene in developing GCs? Wang et al. [ 88 ] found that NFI occupancy in pre-migratory GCs, prior to departure from the EGL and arrival in the GL, is inhibited by binding of the trans -repressor REST to the Gabra6 promoter. REST expression and DNA binding decline as GCPs initiate differentiation, and knockdown of REST selectively enhances the onset of Gabra6 expression and its binding by NFI at early, but not later, developmental times [ 88 ]. Thus, REST is an early repressor of NFI occupancy, preventing premature onset of NFI binding to the Gabra6 gene in pre-migratory GCs within the EGL. Since GC dendrite/synapse formation takes place within the GL additional, post-migratory mechanisms must also be involved in the timing of NFI occupancy. Recent studies identified an NFI developmental \u201cswitch\u201d program operating in GCs maturing within the GL [ 91 ]. This program consists mainly of several hundred NFI-regulated genes expressed with two distinct time frames: \u201cearly\u201d genes downregulated by NFI as the GL matures, and \u201clate,\u201d temporally upregulated genes associated with mature GCs that are activated by NFI [ 91 ]. Importantly, many late-expressed genes participate in dendrite/synapse formation and function, directly implicating the NFI switch program as an essential component of GC synaptic maturation. As observed for Gabra6 , a central feature of the NFI switch program is delayed NFI occupancy of late genes as GCs mature [ 91 ]. So what regulates NFI temporal binding of late genes within the GL? Resting membrane potential is more depolarized in immature GCs and becomes hyperpolarized as the GL matures [ 92 ]. Maintaining cerebellar tissue in a depolarizing medium prevents the maturation of GC dendrites in the GL [ 92 ]. This depolarization block involves activation of voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels (VGCCs) and the Ca 2+ -dependent stimulation of calcineurin phosphatase, which inhibits a gene expression switch [ 93 ]. Voltage-driven mechanisms also regulate the NFI switch [ 91 ]. Importantly, depolarization blocks NFI temporal occupancy of late genes via activation of VGCCs and calcineurin [ 91 ]. Calcineurin activity is elevated in the immature cerebellum and declines with development, consistent with its inhibitory role during GC dendritogenesis in vivo [ 91 ]. Calcineurin promotes NFAT nuclear localization, and NFATc4 mediates the actions of calcineurin on the NFI switch by binding to late genes in immature GCs and repressing NFI occupancy [ 91 ]. This led to a model in which declining calcineurin activity and resultant NFATc4 departure from late genes in the maturing GL becomes permissive for the onset of NFI temporal binding and NFI switch programming (Fig. 4 ). Calcineurin also inhibits GC dendritogenesis via the repressor MEF2A [ 94 ]. Thus, transcriptional de-repression plays an important role in initiating GC dendrite formation. Finally, late-expressed trans - activators (e.g., ETV1 [ 95 ]) also may control the timing of NFI binding and dendritogenesis in the developing GL, subsequent to NFATc4 departure (Fig. 4 ). This may provide greater flexibility in the temporal expression and function of distinct gene subsets during GC dendritogenesis-synaptogenesis. UBCs are a class of small excitatory INs associated with the cerebellar cortex and cerebellar-like structures [ 96 \u2013 100 ]. They are especially enriched in the flocculonodular lobules of\u00a0the cerebellum [ 100 , 101 ] and the dorsal cochlear nucleus [ 100 , 102 , 103 ], regions that process sensorimotor signals regulating head, body, and eye position. Although our knowledge of UBCs derives mainly from studies in rodents, the main features of UBCs are highly conserved across species: UBCs are already recognized in teleosts and are found virtually unchanged in all mammals, including humans [ 100 , 104 \u2013 111 ]. A typical UBC has a single thick dendrite ending in a brush of fine dendrioles, which form a specialized giant synaptic junction with a single mossy fiber terminal (Fig. 5 a; [ 100 , 112 ]). UBC axons branch locally within the GL where they create an intrinsic mossy fiber system superimposed on the canonical extrinsic mossy fiber system [ 100 , 113 , 114 ]. All UBCs are characterized by these morphological features, yet they are classified into type I and type II UBCs, which represent two chemically and functionally distinct subclasses [ 102 , 115 , 116 ] that correspond to the previously identified calretinin (CR)-positive and metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) 1\u03b1-positive UBCs, respectively [ 100 , 101 , 117 \u2013 121 ]. Birthdating studies with bromodeoxyuridine labeling revealed that the two UBC types are also generated within different although overlapping time windows [ 120 ]. In rats, type I UBCs are born around embryonic day E16\u201319 (~E14\u201317 in mouse) while type II UBCs are produced over a longer period of time extending from E18 (in mouse E16) presumably to early postnatal days (P) 0\u20131. Initially, they were suggested to originate from a hotspot in the EGL [ 122 ], but subsequent histological studies indicated a VZ origin [ 123 ]. The definite origin of UBCs was however revealed by genetic fate mapping studies. Englund and colleagues [ 27 ] using TBR2, a T-domain transcription factor, as a marker showed that the UBCs\u2014just as for the other glutamatergic neurons of the cerebellum and cochlear nucleus [ 25 , 26 ]\u2014originate from ATHO1-expressing progenitors of the RL. The UBC progenitors also express WNT1 early in development (E10.5\u201313.5), but the expression is downregulated before UBCs migrate from the RL [ 124 ]. The newly generated UBCs remain in the RL for an additional 1\u20132\u00a0days after which they exit through a narrow channel and migrate to their final destination [ 27 , 38 , 125 ]. The cerebellar UBCs migrate dorsally through the white matter and avoid the cell masses of future CN neurons. Most UBCs reach the GL by P10, several days before GC neurogenesis is complete [ 27 ]. The final differentiation of UBCs occurs between P2 and P28. Morin et al. [ 126 ] divided the maturation of type I UBCs into four distinct stages based on the morphological appearance of the dendritic brush (the protodendritic, filopodial, intermediate brush, and dendriolar brush stages). In the last stage (P21\u2013P28), the UBCs already exhibit mature UBC morphology and, although their brush keeps expanding, it does so without qualitative changes in the dendriolar pattern. Unpublished data (Sekerkov\u00e1 et al.) suggest that somato-dendritic differentiation of the two subtypes is also differentially regulated. In long-term organotypic cerebellar cultures (from P8 mice; 20\u201325\u00a0days in culture), only type II UBCs develop brushes while most of type I UBCs produce long, \u201cbranching\u201d dendrites (Fig. 5 b, c). Moreover, in vivo, type I UBCs undergo chemical changes (Fig. 5 d). Around the first postnatal week, a subset of UBCs co-expresses both CR (the marker of type I) and mGLUR1\u03b1 (the marker of type II UBCs) and fewer than 10\u00a0% of UBCs express only CR. By the third week, the number of double-labeled UBCs decreases dramatically (they virtually disappear by 2\u00a0months of age; [ 100 , 115 ]) and concomitantly the number of the purely CR-positive UBCs increases (to ~33\u00a0% of total UBCs). This suggests different postnatal differentiation mechanisms for the UBC subtypes. The differentiation of the brush and the downregulation of mGLUR1\u03b1 in type I UBCs seem to coincide with the establishment of the first synaptic contacts with external mossy fibers (~P12). GABAergic neurons of the cerebellar cortex comprise projection PCs and local INs. All these cells derive from progenitors pools (PCPs and PIPs, respectively) located in different VZ subregions (see \u201c Glutamatergic Phenotypes \u201d section). Morphologically, PCPs span the ventricular (apical) and pial (basal) surfaces of the cerebellar primordium, taking an elongated (neuroepithelial or radial glial) shape [ 127 ]. How PCPs behave is not well understood: whether they divide symmetrically or asymmetrically, how they undergo interkinetic nuclear migration, and the morphology of newly generated PCs in the VZ all remain unknown. Also, whether (and how) a single class of PCPs changes in a temporally regulated manner to generate the different PC subclasses or whether PCPs are inherently heterogeneous within VZ needs to be studied. Nascent PCs from E14 in mice form a layer several cells thick called the PC plate [ 128 , 129 ]. This transient structure normally spreads through the presumptive cerebellar cortex until late embryonic days, followed by PC-monolayer formation during the early postnatal stage triggered by RELN signaling (see \u201c Development of Cerebellar Compartmentation \u201d section). The supply of PCs to the cortex occurs sequentially [ 129 , 130 ]. PCs generated at E10, especially ones born at the posterior VZ close to the RL, are the first to finish their migration and form the plate [ 131 , 132 ]. This may be because the distance between their birthplace and the goal is the least among the entire PC population (no more than ~200\u00a0\u03bcm). PCs generated at E11 join the plate from E15, followed by E12-born PCs from E16. These later-born PCs (as well as PCs generated anteriorly at E10) need to migrate over much longer distances than the posteriorly E10-born PCs (up to 700\u2013800\u00a0\u03bcm in mice). The early/posterior-born PCs take a tangential migratory route (which is parallel to the pial surface) until E13. They are characterized by long leading processes (100\u00a0\u03bcm or longer), which morphologically and molecularly resemble axons, and a much shorter trailing process containing the Golgi apparatus. This tangential migration crosses radial glial fibers and is reminiscent of that exhibited by RL-derived cells. The initial departure of this early/posterior-born population from the VZ and the subsequent tangential migration are normal in the cerebellum of reeler mice. The early/posterior-born PCs then change orientation by sending the original Golgi-rich trailing process into the cortical region that intensely expresses RELN (produced at E13 by RL-derived tangentially migrating cells of the nuclear transitory zone, NTZ) [ 131 ]. This switchback-like, tangential-to-radial orientation change between E13 and E14 is strictly dependent on RELN. These observations suggest a short-range action of RELN. This model is supported by co-culture experiments showing that PCs (both normal and reeler -derived) will align in vitro along an artificial RELN-rich zone [ 133 ]. However, transgenic reeler mice artificially expressing RELN under the control of the nestin promoter showed an apparently normal (rescued) arrangement of PCs [ 134 ], suggesting that RELN may regulate PC behavior in a context-dependent manner. In contrast to the posterior-born PCs, PCs born more anteriorly exhibit radially oriented somatal morphologies during migration. The close spatial relationship between these PC somata and radial glial fibers supports the prevailing model that PC migration is guided by radial glial fibers [ 129 , 135 ]. These radially oriented PCs at E12 or E13 have axon-like fibers that ascend towards the pia [ 131 ], while post-migratory (late embryonic) PCs forming the plate have downward-directing axons [ 129 , 130 , 136 ]. Several points remain to be elucidated: how these anterior-born PCs proceed the mid-embryonic migration processes, whether these cells are also affected by dynamic changes of cellular orientation or polarity, and how RELN contributes to histogenesis by these radially oriented PCs. The fundamental architecture of the cerebellum is an elaborate pattern of transverse zones and parasagittal stripes [ 137 , 138 ] that is highly reproducible between individuals and conserved across birds [ 139 , 140 ] and mammals (reviewed in [ 141 , 142 ]). Compartmentation is revealed by intrinsic differences between subsets of PCs (e.g., zebrin II/aldolase C (ZII [ 143 ]; phospholipase C (PLC) \u03b23/4 [ 144 ]; HSP25 [ 145 ]), the restriction of INs (reviewed in [ 146 ]), patterns of pathological PC death (reviewed in [ 147 ]), the phenotypes of multiple cerebellar mutants (e.g., lurcher ( Grid Lc )\u2014[ 148 ]; rostral cerebellar malformation ( Unc5c rcm )\u2014[ 149 ]; weaver ( Kcnj6 wv )\u2014[ 150 ]; cerebellar deficient folia ( Ctnna2 cdf )\u2014[ 151 ]), and the topography of afferent and efferent projections (reviewed in [ 152 ]). Cerebellar compartmentation appears to start at ~E10 in the VZ of the fourth ventricle but not earlier, e.g., [ 153 \u2013 156 ]. PC subtype specification likely occurs when PCs undergo terminal mitosis between E10 and E13 [ 54 ] in the Ptf1a -expressing progenitor domain of the VZ ([ 23 , 34 , 49 ]: see \u201c Glutamatergic Phenotypes \u201d section). Birthdating studies have identified two distinct PC populations: an early-born cohort (E10\u2013E11.5) destined to become zebrin II (ZII) + and a late-born cohort (E11.5\u2013E13) destined to become ZII \u2212 . A direct correlation is also found between PC birthdates and their adult stripe location, suggesting that both subtype specification (e.g., ZII + vs. ZII \u2212 ) and positional information (which zone or stripe) are acquired at this time, e.g., [ 30 , 157 \u2013 160 ]; both are cerebellum-intrinsic and not activity- or afferent-dependent, e.g., [ 161 \u2013 164 ]. However, there is no reason to believe that individual PC stripes have a clonal origin. During the same interval, the cerebellar anlage undergoes a 90\u00b0 rotation, which converts the embryonic rostrocaudal axis into the mediolateral axis of the cerebellar primordium [ 156 ]. This suggests the possibility that the adult mediolateral stripe array derives from the anteroposterior patterning of dorsal r1. A Ptf1a -N eurogenin 1 / 2 ( Neurog1 /2)- Early B - cell factor 2 ( Ebf2 ) regulatory network is implicated in PC subtype specification [ 49 ]. By this model, the early-born PC cohort expresses neither Neurog1 / 2 nor Ebf2 and therefore expresses the ZII + phenotype in the adult. Soon after E11, Neurog1 / 2 is upregulated by Ptf1 a in the later-born PC progenitors (e.g., [ 36 ]). In this context, neurogenin 2 regulates cell-cycle progression, neuronal output, and early dendritogenesis of PC progenitors [ 50 ], but neither Neurog1 nor Neurog 2 deletions affect cortical patterning (Hawkes, unpublished observation). In turn, Neurog1 / 2 + precursors express EBF2, which represses the ZII + phenotype ([ 132 , 159 ]: Ebf2 deletion results in transdifferentiated PCs that express markers characteristic of both the ZII + and ZII \u2212 subtypes\u2014the only manipulation known to alter a PC subtype phenotype). In addition, Ebf2 plays an anti-apoptotic role in ZII \u2212 PCs by locally regulating Igf1 gene expression [ 165 ]. As a result of these events, early-born PCs become ZII + in the adult and late-born PCs adopt the ZII \u2212 phenotype. Postmitotic PCs migrate dorsally from the VZ, in part along radial glia processes ([51]: also see Section 4.1), and stack in the cerebellar plate with the earliest-born (Ebf2 \u2212 ) PCs located most dorsally. Starting at ~E14, the cerebellar plate undergoes a complex redisposition, such that by E18 a reproducible array of clusters of multiple molecular phenotypes is present on each side of the midline ([ 166 \u2013 170 ], etc.: reviewed in [ 171 , 172 ]) . The cellular processes that guide cluster formation are not understood but grafts of dissociated PCs also organize into discrete ZII +/\u2212 compartments [ 173 ], pointing to cell-cell adhesion molecules as possible organizers: cadherins are strong candidates reviewed in [ 174 ]. Over 50 distinct clusters have been identified [ 175 , 176 ]. The mapping between embryonic clusters and adult stripes is complex: in some cases, one cluster yields a single stripe, e.g., [ 175 , 177 , 178 ], but in others single stripes derive from the fusion of several clusters, e.g., [ 179 ], or single clusters split into multiple stripes, e.g., [ 136 ]. The embryonic cluster architecture is the scaffold around which other cerebellar elements are organized. First, clusters likely restrict the distribution of cerebellar INs and their processes (GCs\u2014[ 180 ]; Golgi cells\u2014[ 181 ]; stellate/basket cells\u2014[ 146 ]; UBCs\u2014[ 182 ]: reviewed in [ 146 ]: also glia\u2014e.g., [ 183 , 184 ]). Secondly, most afferent projections also enter the cerebellum between E14 and E18 and target specific PC clusters (the so-called matching hypothesis\u2014reviewed in [ 185 ]). There are two major sources of sensory input to the cerebellum: CFs from the inferior olive, and mossy fibers from a number of brain and spinal cord regions. Both afferent systems invade the cerebellum at around E 13/14 in mouse [ 186 , 187 ], and thereafter they terminate with a spatial organization that parallels the pattern of PC stripes [ 137 , 188 ] (Fig. 6 a, b). PC subtype organization is thought to play a key role in instructing circuit wiring into topographic maps. Spontaneous and engineered mouse mutants that display disrupted PC stripes have equivalent alterations in the spatial arrangement of mossy fiber and CF terminals [ 189 \u2013 191 ]. But, what molecular mechanisms trigger cluster dispersal and wiring? From ~E18, the embryonic PC clusters disperse, triggered by RELN secreted by the EGL [ 192 \u2013 194 ]: recently thoroughly reviewed in [ 195 ]. RELN is critical as its deletion in the reeler mouse ( Reln rl : [ 192 , 196 ] blocks dispersal, e.g., [ 128 , 197 ]). One model is that secreted RELN binds two surface receptors on PCs\u2014Apolipoprotein E receptor 2 and the Very Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor. Deletion of either receptor ( Lrp8 tm2Her or Vldlr tm1Her ) produces a partial, stripe-specific disruption of cluster dispersal [ 198 ]: deletion of both receptors blocks dispersal [ 199 ]. In turn, RELN binding induces receptor clustering [ 200 ] and activates two Src-family kinases\u2014Fyn and Src [ 201 , 202 ]\u2014which tyrosine phosphorylate [ 203 , 204 ] the intracellular adaptor docking protein Disabled1 (DAB1\u2014[ 205 \u2013 209 ]: phosphorylation is essential and key tyrosine point mutations phenocopy reeler \u2014[ 210 ]). DAB1-phosphorylation results, at least in the neocortex, in Repressor activator protein 1 (Rap1)-mediated homophilic cadherin 2 cell-cell interactions that promote neuronal migration [ 211 , 212 ]. The upshot is that by ~P20, as cerebellar lobulation matures, the PC clusters string along the rostrocaudal axis into the adult array of long parasagittal stripes. However, one critical question is how do these dynamically changing stripes acquire their functional properties during development? During postnatal development, chemo- and activity-dependent mechanisms may play important (and possibly distinct) roles in establishing the afferent topographical map. There is a long-standing hypothesis that first a \u201ccrude\u201d topographic map is established by genetic cues. And one of the most compelling hypotheses postulates that cues in the afferent source domains match up with cues in the PC map [ 185 ]. The molecular cues that would mediate this mechanism have not been resolved, although it may involve a chemoaffinity mechanism mediated by eph/ephrin and cadherin signaling. But, one has to also consider how the circuit is then sculpted into a \u201cfine\u201d map, and does the mechanism for refining the map also involve PC patterning? Alternatively, are there non-genetic mechanisms that also contribute? Indeed, it was recently shown that the striped patterning of PCs is disrupted when neurotransmission in the PCs themselves is selectively silenced [ 213 ]. Interestingly, the patterning of spinocerebellar mossy fiber terminals into distinct stripes was also altered in the absence of PC activity. The sharp stripe boundaries that are typically observed were severely compromised, although the basic features of the topographic map were left intact. These data argue that neuronal activity may play an important role in fine-tuning the cerebellar map into topographic domains. But maybe PCs are not the only players. Perhaps inhibitory INs in the developing molecular layer (ML) or the millions of excitatory GCs also influence circuit topography by modulating the levels of PC activity. INs, after all, are also organized into stripes [ 146 ] and they integrate into the PC microcircuit at a time when they could have a powerful affect on how the circuit is firing when it is wiring [ 31 ]. Which features of neuronal firing need to be examined in order to understand how circuits assemble? PCs provide the best starting point since these cells exhibit two distinct types of action potential that are experimentally tractable with in vitro and in vivo paradigms. The first are complex spikes that are triggered by CF inputs, and the second are simple spikes generated intrinsically within the PCs but modulated by mossy fiber inputs (Fig. 6 c\u2013c\u02ba, d\u2013d\u02ba). Recent work in anesthetized and awake mice used in vivo electrophysiology to record PC activity in postnatal mice [ 214 ]. The study found that the rate of complex spike firing increased sharply at 3\u00a0weeks of age, whereas the rate of simple spike firing gradually increased until 4\u00a0weeks of age. They also found that compared to adult, the pattern of simple spike firing during development was more irregular as the cells tended to fire in \u201cbursts\u201d that were interrupted by long pauses (Fig. 6 c, d). The regularity in simple spike firing only reached maturity at 4\u00a0weeks of age. These data show that PC activity is dynamically sculpted throughout postnatal development, traversing several critical events that are required for circuit formation. Importantly, the establishment of PC firing properties seems to overlap with the final stages of stripe maturation [ 139 ]. However, there are also data that support an alternate view which suggests that activity-dependent mechanisms may not be involved in topographic wiring. Surgically lesioning the neonatal spinocerebellar afferent tracts did not induce a competitive sprouting of the adjacent cuneocerebellar pathway [ 215 ] and the regression of supernumerary CFs appears spatially and temporally unlinked to the formation\u00a0of stripe patterns\u2014both processes may be strictly dependent on molecular cues [ 216 ]. Therefore, it is interesting to speculate that compared to molecular cues, the rate and pattern of spikes, at particular ages, could shape a more subtle level of topography by refining the connectivity within stripes rather than between individual stripes. If this was to be the case, then chemical tags might define the fundamental patterns of stripes irrespective of sensory experience, and perhaps only later during postnatal development is when activity might tune and complete the existing map. The term \u201cGABAergic interneuron\u201d is traditionally used to refer to a diverse set of neurons that, in the healthy adult cerebellum, result in local inhibition (Fig. 7 ). Actually, it is somewhat of a misnomer since in CN and the GL, the majority of GABAergic INs also use glycine as a co-transmitter, and a few are strictly glycinergic [ 217 , 218 ]. Distinct differences in their afferent and efferent wiring, their morphology, and the differential expression of a set of molecular markers (inter alia mGluR2 and neurogranin) allow us to distinguish, in the GL, at least four discrete sets of Golgi cells sensu stricto as well as Lugaro and globular cells. While these clearly distinct inhibitory INs of the GL are sometimes collectively referred to as Golgi cells, INs of the ML are traditionally classified as basket or stellate cells. Today, the weight of the evidence rather supports the view that these two terms describe two exemplary variants of one population that shows gradual morphological [ 219 ] and molecular [ 220 ] differences which may be secondary to their position in the ML (discussed in [ 146 ]). Lastly, the still rather enigmatic candelabrum cell [ 221 ] may be yet another member of the basket/stellate class (see [ 222 ] for a broader discussion). GABAergic INs are produced from late embryonic life to the second postnatal week, according to a precise inside-out sequence (Fig. 7 ). The proliferation of inhibitory INs peaks during the first postnatal week and exclusively occurs in the PWM, a postnatal niche containing heterogeneous cell types at different maturation stages [ 29 , 32 , 223 \u2013 227 ]. CN INs are the first to be born during embryonic and early postnatal life, followed by GL INs (Golgi and Lugaro cells) and, finally, by those of the ML (basket and stellate cells; [ 29 , 31 , 225 , 228 ]). The first studies of cerebellar neurogenesis postulated that ML INs derive from the EGL, the only germinal layer known at that time to be active during postnatal development [ 229 , 230 ]. Later, analysis of chick-quail chimeras, transplantation experiments, and retroviral injections demonstrated that the EGL exclusively generates GCs and indicated that all the GABAergic neurons, including the ML INs, derive from the VZ [ 154 , 231 \u2013 234 ]. While these diverse cells all originate from the VZ, there is little evidence that this germinal layer is pre-patterned, say by differential gene expression, such as to presage the diversity of cerebellar inhibitory INs in the adult. One possible exception may be the expression of Neurog1, which may distinguish the lineages leading to cerebellar cortical and CN inhibitory INs ([ 235 , 236 ]: the interpretation of these results is ambiguous because the BAC used may not faithfully recapitulate cognate Ngn1 expression, specifically in CN [ 235 ]). In contrast, there is compelling experimental evidence that PIPs maintain a high degree of plasticity and acquire their definitive fate only as they migrate through the deep cerebella mass (i.e., the PWM) on their way into the CN or the nascent cerebellar cortex [ 237 ]. This is particularly striking as individual subsets of cerebellar cortical inhibitory INs withdraw from the cell cycle over an extended period from E13 through the second postnatal week. However, cells collected at any point through this long generative phase are capable, when heterochronously transplanted, of acquiring a fate temporally appropriate to the host tissue [ 237 ]. Significantly, fate determination by transplanted cells is critically dependent on migration through the recipient\u2019s PWM. These findings have led to the recognition of the nascent white matter as an instructive niche critical for the maturation and diversification of cerebellar inhibitory INs [ 237 ]. Unfortunately, we are still quite ignorant as to how this instruction is realized on the molecular level. There is experimental evidence that PC-derived SHH regulates proliferation of precursors of cerebellar inhibitory INs in and near the ventricular epithelium [ 33 , 238 ]; yet, whether PCs also influence the diversification of these cells remains unclear. The dividing intermediate progenitors that are responsible for the extensive amplification of the inhibitory interneuron populations strongly express Ptf1a [ 33 ]. At later stages, the precursors of inhibitory INs are seen as a population of Pax-2 + cells that appears in the VZ around E12.5 and later moves into the cerebellar parenchyma [ 32 , 228 ]. The precise lineage relationships linking Ptf1a + interneuron progenitors to the other precursor pools in the PWM (namely, progenitors of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) remained obscure for many years. The existence of multipotent progenitors in the postnatal cerebellum has been proposed by two independent studies [ 239 , 240 ], in which the isolated progenitors were able to form neurospheres and to differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes both in vitro and in vivo after grafting into newborn mice [ 239 , 240 ]. A series of more recent studies have clarified the properties of PWM progenitors and the relationships between the different lineages. For instance, it has been shown that the postnatal cerebella of mice lacking the proneural gene Ascl - 1 have fewer PAX-2 + INs and increased numbers of SOX9 + astrocytes compared to controls [ 241 ]. Conversely, overexpression of ASCl-1 in the VZ results in more INs at the expense of astrocytes [ 241 ], suggesting the existence of lineage relationships between these cell types throughout cerebellar development. It is not clear whether similar relationships between INs and astrocytes are also present at earlier embryonic ages. Indeed, previous fate mapping analyses tagging embryonic progenitors producing PCs or INs only rarely generated astrocytes [ 34 , 50 ], suggesting that the bulk of cerebellar astrocytes do not derive from these progenitors. Subsequent lineage analysis during embryonic and postnatal development showed that both INs and astrocytes derive from ASCL-1 + precursors [ 31 ]. Similarly, fate-mapping studies of progenitors with astroglial traits\u2014such as the expression of hGFAP [ 242 ], TenascinC [ 33 ], and GLAST [ 227 ]\u2014reveal that the progeny of such progenitors often comprise a mixed population of astrocytes and GABAergic INs. In particular, in the study of Fleming et al. [ 33 ], a population of primary CD133 + TenC + astroglial progenitors was identified in the PWM as the putative source of both PTF1-a + intermediate IN progenitors and CD15 + intermediate astrocyte precursors. The existence of these bipotent progenitors has been confirmed by a recent study in which mixed clones of INs and astrocytes were derived from PWM astroglial progenitors both in vitro and in vivo [ 227 ]. Finally, PCs are critical for the terminal differentiation and morphogenesis of cerebellar INs. Specifically, the complexity of basket/stellate cell axonal arborizations and their positioning on PCs is critically dependent on neurofascin [ 243 , 244 ] and also Semaphorin (Sema3a)/neuropilin-1-mediated signaling between PCs and differentiating ML INs [ 245 ]. Further, the preferential orientation of basket/stellate cell axons in the sagittal plane may be due to PC guidance, as they extend in the ML [ 146 ]. Conversely, dendritic differentiation of basket/stellate cells appears primarily sensitive to GC-derived input, including BDNF [ 246 ] and signaling through the GluD1 receptor. In fact, ablation of this receptor, which is highly expressed in ML INs and concentrated at their synapses with PFs, results in reduced survival and stunted growth of early post-migratory ML INs [ 247 ]. The description of cerebellar development above is focused on the cerebellar cortex. The CN develop in parallel, using much of the same molecular machinery. The CN dictate the participation of the cerebellum in a range of circuits by providing an almost exclusive efferent connectivity via axon pathways to more caudal structures (from medial nuclei) and more rostral structures projections (from lateral nuclei; [ 248 ]). Their largely spontaneously active output can be excitatory or inhibitory and nuclei contain several different local interneuron types [ 249 \u2013 253 ]. Nuclei receive collateral input from afferents to the cerebellar cortex (CFs and mossy fibers) in addition to inhibitory input from PCs. Decoding both the development and integrative function of nuclear circuits is likely to be critical for understanding the broader function of the cerebellum. Despite their functional significance, our knowledge of CN development is incomplete. Furthermore, the number of CN varies between tetrapod species suggesting that the developmental mechanisms responsible for their patterning are a key locus of evolutionary adaptation [ 254 ]. The perhaps surprising absence of a detailed description of CN specification and maturation can to some extent be explained by a major conceptual revision of their development over the last 10\u00a0years following insights from a series of studies of gene expression [ 51 , 60 ] and genetic fate-maps [ 25 , 26 , 34 , 255 ]. Prior to this, CN, which condense initially in a \u201cnuclear transitory zone\u201d at the margin of the cerebellar anlage, were assessed by birthdate to be derived exclusively from the VZ [ 256 ]. This assumption was overturned by genetic lineage maps using an Atoh1 reporter showing that excitatory CN neurons arise by tangential migration from the RL prior to GCP production [ 25 , 26 ]. More recent mapping using a Ptf1a reporter [ 36 ] reveals that the VZ gives rise only to inhibitory neurons of the CN. Hence, just as for the cerebellar cortex, the assembly of CN is defined as the coordinated integration of PTF1a + and ATHO1 + lineages in local circuits. However, patterns of temporal specification in either lineage suggest important differences compared to the cerebellar cortex in how these lineages interact. Ptf1a -derived CN neurons are generated as the first of a sequence of inhibitory neurons destined for progressively more superficial fates [ 29 ]. To some extent, this reflects a progressive dorsal expansion of a Gsx1 + /Ptf1a domain that gives rise to INs, which occupy the Olig2 / Ptf1a domain and give rise to PCs (see \u201c Specification of Cerebellar Progenitors \u201d section). However, fate determination in the former Pax - 2 + lineage is notably a product of local microenvironmental factors. Migrating PIPs persist in the white matter, continuing to contribute to the CN ([ 29 , 36 ]: see \u201c GABAergic Interneurons \u201d section) well beyond the production of the first, inhibitory projection neurons (Fig. 8 ). By contrast, cell fate in the ATHO1 + CN derivatives of the RL not only correlates with birthdate [ 25 , 26 , 257 ] but appears determined at the RL [ 258 ]. This raises the possibility that the temporal pattern of RL derivatives establishes a template around which GABAergic neurons are organized. The allocation of a temporal framework of RL-derived CN components is accompanied by a characterized sequence of transcriptional maturation [ 51 , 60 ] that results in a first born LHX9 + lateral nucleus (projecting to midbrain and thalamus), followed by a TBR1 + medial (fastigial) group, which sends axons to the hindbrain via the fasciculus uncinatus, or hook bundle [ 257 ]. The progressive deposition of cells in more dorsal (ultimately medial) positions reflects a decreasing sensitivity to netrin signaling from ventral midline in migrating cells [ 259 , 260 ]. Netrin receptors are also responsible for determining the laterality of the projections of CN axons [ 261 ], which extend seamlessly from the leading processes of migrating cells [ 260 ]. Target selection itself (rostral or caudal CNS) appears to be a property of LHX9 [ 257 ] versus TBR1 [ 59 ] expression. If this process of RL cell fate specification provides a template for nucleus assembly, it places a special emphasis on poorly understood events at the NTZ. It is here that neurons segregate into a series of mediolaterally distributed nuclei as they are subducted under the rapidly expanded cortex by either passive displacement, or possibly active translocation [ 256 ]. To understand whether lineage interactions are part of this process, let alone underlying mechanisms of nucleogenesis, will rely on a better description of neurons subtypes. For example, it is unclear whether only more lateral nuclei contain inhibitory projection neurons [ 252 , 262 ] or indeed how much of the repertoire of neurons seen in the lateral nucleus is recruited to other nuclei [ 263 ]. Similarly, the embedded nature of nuclei within a series of re-entrant loops that include the inferior olive, in addition to pontine neurons and PCs, has implications for later developmental events. How does the convergence of afferents onto nuclei influence the organization of INs into precise, geometric functional units [ 249 ]? These elements of fine-grained developmental detail, which are so significant for the function of the cerebellar circuit, are almost completely unexplored. In contrast to other CNS areas in which gliogenesis follows neurogenesis, in the cerebellum the generation of glia parallels the generation of GCs and INs. What triggers the activation of gliogenesis and regulates its course in this territory is still poorly understood. In the mature mammalian cerebellum, four astroglial subtypes are classically distinguished, including fibrous astrocytes in the white matter (WM), stellate multipolar astrocytes with profuse tiny processes (velate astrocytes) or more slender morphologies (protoplasmic astrocytes) in the GL, and neuroepithelial cells displaying radial BG basal processes spanning from the cells bodies in the PC layer through the entire ML, up to the subpial basement membrane (Fig. 9 a, [ 130 , 229 , 264 ]). In the future, this classification may expand to comprise more astroglial subtypes based on neurochemical, topographical, and morphological criteria, as shown by a recent detailed investigation on the human cerebellum [ 265 ]. Through the comparative analysis of different mammalian species, Ram\u00f3n y Cajal [ 229 ] proposed that cerebellar astroglia derive from the VZ. Cajal\u2019s interpretation has been fully proved by means of fate mapping analyses in mice in which radial glial progenitors (RG) at the ventricle were targeted based on the expression of stem-cell markers [ 266 \u2013 268 ], or VZ-restricted tags [ 34 ]. A small contribution of the RL to cerebellar astrogliogenesis has also been proposed [ 269 ] but so far remains controversial (see [ 270 ] and references therein). As showed by anatomical investigations and functional manipulation of regulatory pathways, in a first astrogliogenic wave (up to about E14 in mouse), RG detach from the ventricle and displace the cell body towards the nascent PWM, transforming into progenitors of BG ([ 229 , 266 , 271 , 272 ]: the relationship between astrocytes and GABAergic INs is reviewed in \u201cGABAergic Interneurons\u201d section). A subset of these precursors appears to be already postmitotic at the moment of translocation [ 31 ] and readily differentiates into BG. Conversely, other precursors form a proliferative layer that expands [ 130 , 266 , 271 ] up to the first postnatal week in parallel with the tangential expansion of the cerebellar surface. At later stages of embryonic development, a second wave of astroglial-like progenitors lacking the basal process delaminates from the VN into the cerebellar PWM where they proliferate, forming astrocytes populating the prospective GL and white matter [ 130 , 271 ]. Whether PWM astroglial progenitors also produce some BG or whether proliferating BG contribute astrocytes to other cortical layers remains to be established. Similarly, the dynamics and timing of the amplification of astroglial progenitors are largely unknown. How the specialization of the astroglial subsets is achieved is only partially clarified. BG morphogenesis requires a tight and timely regulated interaction with the surrounding cerebellar microenvironment (basement membrane, PCs, migratory and proliferative GCs, see Fig. 9 b). Notably, impairment of these regulatory mechanisms results in BG malpositioning and/or the acquisition of a stellate morphology, which may thus represent a default differentiation pathway for cerebellar astroglial precursors. Yet, it is likely that the refinement of the variety of multipolar morphologies in the GL and WM is instructed by local cues. Further, few intrinsic determinants are known that take part in the establishment of distinct astroglial cerebellar phenotypes (see [ 270 ]). In contrast to astrocytes, so far no evidence clearly demonstrates the derivation of oligodendrocytes from the cerebellar VZ [ 241 ]. Rather, a minor oligodendroglial fraction appears to derive from progenitors in subventricular positions, likely residing in the PWM [ 31 , 273 ]. Alternatively, mouse transplantation experiments indicate an extracerebellar origin for the majority of oligodendrocytes [ 241 ]. In line with these data, experiments in chick-quail chimeras and in ovo transplants in the chick brain demonstrated that cerebellar oligodendroglia are generated in the chick mesencephalic neuroepithelium and only subsequently invade the cerebellum via the velum medullare [ 274 ]. A similar extracerebellar source in the mammalian brain remains to be identified. Further, fate-mapping analyses [ 242 ] support the hypothesis that the majority of cerebellar oligodendrocytes have no lineage relationships with cerebellar astrocytes (and neurons). However, ex vivo experiments [ 275 ] and functional deletion of the polycomb group protein Bmi1 [ 273 ] pointed to the existence of bipotent gliogenic precursors, whose identity remains to be established. Once settled in the cerebellar primordium, oligodendrocyte progenitors first surround the CN and gradually invade the nascent cortical lobules, progressing in a centrifugal direction. The same pattern is reflected in the course of both differentiation and myelination that proceed from the inner cerebellar portions to the lobule apices [ 276 \u2013 279 ]. Despite the fact that most intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms regulating oligodendrocyte differentiation appear to be common to multiple CNS sites, including the cerebellum [ 280 , 281 ], a particular role in the regulation of the maturation of cerebellar oligodendroglia is exerted by thyroid hormones (TH; L-triiodothyronine, T3; L-tetraiodothyronine, thyroxine, T4; see \u201c The Role of Thyroid Hormone in Cerebellar Development \u201d section) and PC-derived signals. In particular, PCs secrete SHH, which stimulates oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation at early postnatal stages, whereas by the end of the first postnatal week, they start producing vitronectin, which drives oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin formation [ 282 ]. The SHH pathway has been extensively studied in the context of GCP proliferation. However, more recent studies have revealed additional roles for this important pathway during different phases of cerebellar development. The common theme emerging from these studies is that SHH is a key mitogen for the expansion of functionally diverse neuronal and glial cell types from spatially and temporally restricted precursors. However, the mechanisms by which SHH stimulates proliferation of these precursors appear to be distinct, involving both cerebellar and extracerebellar strategies (Fig. 10 ). In the cerebellum, Shh expression is restricted to PCs starting at E16.5 and continuing throughout adulthood [ 42 , 283 ]. The early phase of Shh expression is critical for rapid clonal expansion of GCPs as blockade of Shh expression in PCs leads to drastic reduction of GCP number in the EGL [ 62 , 283 \u2013 285 ]. The expansion of GCPs requires the cell surface proteins BOC and GAS1 [ 286 ], which synergistically promote SHH binding to its receptors PTCH1/2. In the absence of Shh , PTCH1 functions as a negative regulator of SHH signaling by suppressing the activity and localization of a seven-pass transmembrane protein, smoothened (SMO) to the primary cilium, a slim, microtubule-based non-motile structure that projects from the surface of nearly all vertebrate cells [ 287 , 288 ]. Therefore, SHH binding to PTCH1 relieves SMO from inhibition, triggering SHH signaling and subsequently activating downstream target gene expression mediated by the GLI family of transcription factors [ 289 ]. Accordingly, mutations in ciliary components that disrupt SMO localization to the tip of the cilium all lead to altered SHH signaling and reduced GCP proliferation [ 290 , 291 ]. Among the three GLI proteins, GLI2 acts as the primary transcriptional activator in GCPs [ 292 ]. In addition to canonical GLI target genes Gli1 , Hhip , and Ptch1 , several others including MycN and CcndD1 involved in cell-cycle regulation of GCPs have been reported [ 293 , 294 ]. Notably, cerebellar phenotype in the absence of MycN function resembles that of Shh mutants [ 63 ]. Recent studies show that activation of GLI-dependent target genes is facilitated by JMJD3, a H3k27me3 demethylase involved in epigenetic conversion of inactive to active chromatin state [ 295 ], highlighting the importance of chromatin modification in enabling GCPs to respond to SHH during cerebellar development. While Shh expression persists in PCs, GCPs eventually exit the cell cycle and differentiate to GCs. This process, as shown by recent studies, appears to be promoted by the transcriptional repressor BCL6 through recruitment of BCOR co-repressor and SIRT1 deacetylase to the Gli1 and Gli2 promoter regions, thus epigenetically silencing their expressions [ 296 ]. Removal of p53 rescues GCPs from cell death and restores their proliferation. However, it is unclear how BCL6 is activated in the immature GCs [ 296 ]. In addition to GCPs, SHH signaling is also required for the expansion of GABAergic INs by regulating precursors in two different neurogenic niches [ 33 , 42 ]. In the VZ niche, SHH signaling is activated in multipotent radial glial cells after E12.5. Defective SHH signaling in VZ severely impairs the proliferation of radial glial cells and their ability to generate GABAergic interneuron progenitors during the embryonic period [ 42 ]. Conversely, persistent activation of SHH signaling greatly expands their numbers. The source of SHH signal acting on VZ radial glial cells appears to be extracerebellar as SHH expression is not yet established in the emerging PC population. Indeed, SHH is prominently expressed in the hindbrain choroid plexus epithelium (hCPe), a secretory organ whose development is in close apposition with the cerebellar VZ (Fig. 10 a). The presence of SHH protein in the circulating embryonic cerebrospinal fluid suggests that SHH is actively secreted from the hCPe and delivered to the adjacent VZ via a transventricular mechanism. Further support for this model comes from the observation that VZ progenitor proliferation is compromised in mice with reduced Shh expression in the hCPe [ 42 ]. The cerebellar VZ is also the source for stem-like astroglial cells of the secondary neurogenic niche residing in the PWM during late embryonic and postnatal period [ 33 , 239 , 242 ]. These astroglial cells transiently respond to PC-derived SHH and express cell surface marker CD133 (also referred to as Prominin) as well as extracellular matrix glycoprotein Tenascin-C (Tnc) [ 33 ]. Lineage analysis reveals that the PWM astroglial cells generate intermediate progenitors of both astrocytes and GABAergic INs as marked by the expression of CD15 and PTF1a, respectively (Fig. 10 b) [ 33 ]. Furthermore, attenuation of SHH signaling in astroglia during the neonatal period leads to a significant reduction of both intermediate progenitor classes, underscoring the importance of SHH signaling in the maintenance of the PWM niche. Surprisingly, PTF1a-expressing GABAergic progenitors represent an additional population that responds to SHH in PWM [ 33 , 238 ]. In contrast to cerebellar VZ [ 42 ], these PTF1a-expressing progenitors are proliferative and likely responsible for rapid expansion of the late-born GABAergic INs during the first week of the postnatal period [ 225 ]. The most striking morphological feature of the cerebellum of birds, mammals, and some fish is its foliation pattern, or subdivision into lobes, lobules, and sublobules that are separated by a series of fissures [ 130 , 171 , 297 , 298 ] (Fig. 11 a). In most species, the foliation pattern is symmetrical with respect to the midline, and the fissures run perpendicular to the anterior-posterior (AP) axis in the medial cerebellum (vermis) of most species. The mammalian cerebellum is further subdivided into two lateral hemispheres and adjacent flocculi/paraflocculi, each with distinct foliation patterns with fissures that vary in their orientation. Nevertheless, the lobules of the hemispheres are continuous with lobules in the vermis (Fig. 11 b). Larsell proposed a unified scheme for naming the lobules in the vermis of birds and mammals with roman numerals I\u2013X from anterior to posterior [ 299 , 300 ]. To account for the variation in foliation pattern between species and the fact that the cerebellum has more than ten lobules in many species, lobules were subdivided into sublobules separated by shallower fissures (e.g., VIa and VIb, Fig. 11 c). The vermis of mice has eight or nine lobules, as lobules I/II are not separated in some strains and IV/V are fused, and the hemispheres have four lobules [ 301 , 302 ] that extend laterally from lobules VI and VII (Fig. 11 b, c). The basic pattern of vermis foliation is conserved throughout mammals, but foliation in the hemispheres is more variable than in the vermis and is very complex in primates (see discussion in Chapter 1 of [ 130 ], [ 303 ]). As the cerebellum modulates the functions of all areas of the neocortex [ 304 ], by extrapolation the development of the two brain regions should have co-evolved. Indeed, the entire spinocerebellar tract projects only to the medial cerebellum, thus the hemispheres are enriched for connections to the neocortex. Furthermore, although the volume of the cerebellum as a percentage of the total brain is constant across species [ 305 , 306 ], the greatest proportional increase in brain regions has occurred in the cerebellum and neocortex [ 306 ], and the ratio of the number of neurons in the cerebellum to the neocortex is remarkably constant across mammalian species [ 307 ]. It is therefore tempting to speculate that during evolution particular lobules in the hemispheres and folds (gyri) in the neocortex of gyrencephalic mammals that house interconnected neural circuits have arisen and expanded in unison [ 308 ]. Defining the circuits between the cerebellum and neocortex in primates as well as rodents is a major challenge and high priority for future cerebellar research, but dependent on development of effective tools for tracing across multiple synapses. It will be exciting to trace the axon pathways from a parasagittal stripe of PCs in one region of a particular lobule through to the neocortex and back to the cerebellum. One hypothesis is that this will reveal an elaborate spatial organization of neurons, with ones dedicated to similar functions being housed in distinct lobules in the cerebellum and gyri in the neocortex, and with new circuits discovered specific to humans. The cerebellum undergoes its major growth in the third trimester and infant stage in humans, and the first 2\u00a0weeks after birth in mice, primarily due to expansion of GCPs [ 130 , 309 , 310 ]. The surface area of the cerebellum increases during development much more than its volume due to the formation of lobules [ 311 \u2013 314 ]. The lobules thus serve to house a large number of neurons in a layered cytoarchitecture in a small area. Foliation begins at E16.5 in the mouse with the sequential formation of the base of each fissure, which we have termed anchoring centers [ 315 ]. The GCPs, PCs, and BG within anchoring centers have distinct characteristics, and the lobules grow out away from them [ 314 , 315 ]. The first sign of formation of an anchoring center is an inward thickening of the EGL that is followed by formation of an indentation of the outer surface of the cerebellum and elongation of the bodies of the GCPs (Fig. 11 d, [ 315 ]). The underlying PC layer indents and then the surrounding fibers of BG project to the base of the fissure. In the mouse vermis, four initial anchoring centers form that defines five initial lobes, which are further subdivided. Based on mutant analysis, the timing of formation and position of two adjacent anchoring centers define the morphology of the intervening lobule and thus the allocation of cells available for distinct long-range circuits [ 315 \u2013 317 ]. Importantly, the homeobox engrailed genes ( En1 / 2 ) are fundamental to the patterning process as they determine when particular anchoring centers form [ 315 \u2013 320 ]. A number of theories have been proposed for how foliation is regulated [ 130 , 315 , 321 \u2013 323 ]. Fundamental questions remain, such as whether one cell type initiates formation of anchoring centers and how are they positioned. Clonal analysis previously uncovered that GCPs divide symmetrically to expand each clone and then differentiate en masse [ 324 ]. Surprisingly, from a clonal analysis of GCPs, we recently found that the anchoring centers act as lineage restrictions that prevent GCPs from moving between lobules [ 325 ]. One possibility is that the restriction in GCP movement produces a mechanical force driving the lobules outward. Furthermore, the number of cells per clone in long lobules is almost twice that in short ones. In terms of clone geometry, the length is greater in the AP than medial-lateral axis in all EGL clones, especially in long lobules, accounting for the tremendous AP expansion of the cerebellum (Fig. 11 e). Moreover, in En1 / 2 mutants with smaller lobules, the size and geometry of clones is similar to wild-type clones in short lobules [ 325 ]. Thus, the dynamics of GCP expansion is differentially regulated in lobules with different shapes/sizes. Whether this is a cell intrinsic property of GCPs that form different lobules that is established before anchoring centers are formed remains to be determined. What forces within and outside the cerebellum impact on the foliation process is an additional critical question to address. A further question is how scaling of all cell types in the cerebellum is regulated to ensure that the correct proportions of all neurons/glia are allocated to each lobule. One interesting possibility is that SHH secreted by PCs [ 285 , 292 ] determines the expansion of INs and astrocyte/BG progenitors in unison with regulating GCP proliferation [ 33 , 64 , 285 , 326 ]. The cerebellum arose in gnathostomes, but the emergence of a stable transient amplifying population of GCPs in an EGL structure that is stimulated by SHH seems to date to the transition to amniotes [ 326 \u2013 332 ]. While the production of the enormous number of granule neurons (>50\u00a0% of all neurons in mouse and human [ 333 , 334 ]) is thought to drive foliation [ 130 ] and has been experimentally linked to foliation, e.g., [ 64 , 335 ], it is important to point out that some sharks have extensively foliated cerebella [ 336 ]. Interestingly, the degree of foliation seems to correlate better with the ecological environment and/or complexity of prey behavior within and between clades rather than with phylogeny [ 306 , 336 ]. An important question to resolve is whether the ratio of GCs to PCs is increased in sharks with highly foliated cerebella. Although it is not known whether SHH stimulates neurogenesis and of what cell types in sharks, it will be interesting to determine whether the SHH pathway has been co-opted to increase GC production in sharks since Shh has been detected in PCs of a shark but not in zebrafish [ 327 ]. Furthermore, given the different cytoarchitecture of the shark cerebellum, the mechanisms underlying foliation could be distinct from that in amniotes. Determining the similarities and differences in the foliation processes between sharks and amniotes and their implications for circuit allocation will be valuable, and likely to have implications for formation of folds in the neocortex of gyrencephalic mammals. PCs in the adult cerebellum receive two distinctive excitatory synaptic inputs\u2014from PFs, the axons of GCs, and from CFs arising from the inferior olivary nuclei in the medulla oblongata. Each PC receives functionally weak but numerous (~100,000 in mice) PF synapses on spines of its distal dendrites. In contrast, most PCs are innervated by a single but functionally very strong CF on the stubby spines of their proximal dendrites. However, in the neonatal cerebellum, each PC is innervated on the soma by multiple CFs [ 337 ]. How is the adult one to one relationship between a CF and a PC established during postnatal development? Immature olivocerebellar axons extensively ramify in the white matter and the GC layer, and give rise to many collaterals around PCs (creeper stage) [ 338 ]. Since immature PCs have no large primary dendrites, CFs terminate on perisomatic protrusions and thorns emerging from the PC somata. By P2\u2013P3, several individual CFs form multiple synapses with relatively similar synaptic strengths on a single PC (Fig. 12) . During the first postnatal week, a single CF is selectively strengthened on the soma of each PC (termed \u201cfunctional differentiation\u201d). Mice deficient in Cav2.1, the \u03b1-subunit of the P/Q-type voltage-dependent Ca 2+ channel (VDCC), show impairment in the selective strengthening of a single CF, suggesting that activity-dependent Ca 2+ influx through VDCCs is crucial for establishing a single \u201cwinner\u201d CF on each PC [ 339 , 340 ]. Next, the strongest CF extends its innervation territory from the soma to the dendrites (\u201cCF translocation\u201d: Fig. 12 ). As mentioned above, CFs initially establish synaptic contacts on the fine processes emerging from the soma and form a plexus (\u201cpericellular nest\u201d stage) [ 229 ]. As the dendrites of the PCs start to grow into the ML, from around P6, multiple CFs continue to innervate the PC somata until P9. After the functional differentiation of CFs, only the \u201cwinner\u201d CF extends its innervation territory from the soma to the stem dendrites from P9 (\u201ccapuchon\u201d stage) [ 229 ]. In the \u201cdendritic\u201d stage [ 229 ], CF synapses undergo progressive translocation to the growing PC dendrites. In contrast, the \u201closer\u201d CFs remain around the soma and are eventually eliminated in two distinct phases (the \u201cearly and late phases of CF elimination\u201d) mediated by distinct mechanisms [ 216 , 339 , 340 ]. The early phase of CF synapse elimination starts at around P7 soon after the functional differentiation is completed. Unlike the late phase of CF synapse elimination, the early phase is not dependent on the proper generation of GCs and PF-PC synapses. Several lines of evidence suggest that neuronal activity is crucial for this event [ 339 , 340 ]. The late phase of CF synapse elimination starts at around P12 [ 216 , 339 , 340 ]. This process is critically dependent on the proper formation of excitatory PF synapses and inhibitory basket cell synapses on PCs. In mice deficient in mGluR1 or any of its downstream signaling molecules (G\u03b1q, PLC\u03b24, PKC\u03b3), the late phase of CF elimination is severely impaired. The immediate early gene Arc / Arg3.1 , the neurotrophin receptor TrkB, and insulin-like growth factor 1 are also involved in CF synapse elimination [ 339 , 340 ]. A recent study has revealed that postsynaptic Sema7A, a GPI linked subtype of Semaphorin, and its receptors (ItgB1 and PlxnC1) on CFs are involved in the cascade downstream of mGluR1 [ 341 ]. In contrast, Sema3A, a secreted class of Semaphorin, and its receptors (PlxnA4) on CFs maintain both weak and strong CFs from P8 to P18, and therefore oppose synapse elimination [ 341 ]. Thus, semaphorins mediate retrograde signals from PCs to CFs that regulate multiple processes of CF synapse elimination. The PC stands as a neuronal model to study dendritic differentiation. In addition to being beautiful, PCs are also popular because of their convenience in terms of ease of immunohistochemical detection and genetic manipulation. Proteins such as calbindin or IP3R (inositol phosphate 3 receptor) are specifically abundantly expressed in PCs and label their dendritic tree, soma, and axon. Grafting experiments have provided major progress in our understanding of the biology of neurons [ 342 ]. The L7/pcp2 promoter drives gene expression specifically in PCs and retinal rod bipolar neurons [ 343 ]. Combining the L7 promoter and an inducible CRE/loxP system with in utero electroporation allows the specific regulation of gene expression in PCs in a temporally controlled manner [ 344 ]. Furthermore, different viral vectors target PCs specifically [ 345 ] for review. Last but not least, for the study of the development of the dendritic tree, PCs can develop in organotypic cultures. By using this technique, the morphology of individual PCs can be studied since they are isolated from their neighbors [ 346 , 347 ]. Adult PCs are highly recognizable by their large dendritic tree with prototypical morphological characteristics (Fig. 13 a). One characteristic of the PC dendritic tree is that its extension and ramification occurs in the sagittal plane, resembling an espaliered fruit tree [ 229 ]. This highly stereotyped and simple architecture in a two-dimensional plane is likely at the origin of the PC\u2019s popularity: many neurobiologists, among them Ferdinando Rossi, have been fascinated by their beauty, e.g., [ 348 ]. The development of this spectacular dendritic tree occurs during the first three postnatal weeks of the mouse life. Interestingly, it is not a linear process as there is a clear discontinuity at the end of the first postnatal week. During the first postnatal week, successions of growth and retraction have been described [ 349 , 350 ]. Immature PCs present a panel of very different morphological forms (Fig. 13 b,c). In the absence of time-lapse analyses, the relations between these different morphological forms are not yet well understood. It is only from the second postnatal week on that PCs develop their characteristic dendritic trees (Fig. 13 d). At the beginning of the second postnatal week, the PCs have a single stem segment at the apical pole that already presages the form of the mature dendritic tree. During the second postnatal week, and up to the end of the third postnatal week, the dendritic tree grows first wider and then taller [ 351 ]. By using virus-mediated gene transfer followed by three-dimensional reconstruction of confocal images of labeled PCs, Kaneko et al. [ 352 ] demonstrated that PCs achieve their monoplanar configuration by the dynamic remodeling of an initially irregular arrangement extended in multiple sagittal planes during the third postnatal week in mice. The transition between these two morphological developmental phases\u2014a first phase of intense remodeling and a second phase of continuous development of the mature dendritic tree\u2014occurs in parallel with profound functional transitions [ 353 , 354 ]. As they occur in parallel with a circulating peak of TH and the acquisition of the ability to walk outside the mother nest, we have proposed that these transitions are reminiscent of amphibian metamorphosis [ 354 , 355 ]. Numerous intrinsic or environmental factors regulate the dendritic development of PCs (for reviews see [ 342 , 345 , 356 , 357 ]) and indeed, understanding the development and the maintenance of the dendritic tree is far from being accomplished. Recent studies of PCs have shed light on new mechanisms. For example, the PC is one of the rare types of neurons in which factors involved in the maintenance of dendritic tree have been identified [ 358 ]. In mammals, mechanisms of dendritic self-avoidance, a critical process in patterning neural circuits during development, has also been reported in [ 359 , 360 ]. Last, in parallel to the classic neurotrophic theory for axons, developing PC dendrites compete for limiting amounts of Neurotrophin-3 (NT3) and require anterograde NT3 from their presynaptic partners in order to grow [ 361 ]. Numerous cerebellar malformations have been described in humans, primarily classified by MRI studies, and can occur in isolation or as part of a broader malformation syndrome involving multiple systems. Most cause cognitive in addition to motor and sensory integration deficits [ 362 , 363 ]. Cerebellar developmental mechanisms are well conserved between humans and rodents, making studies in mice highly informative towards defining pathogenic mechanisms. Notably, however, cerebellar development in humans begins around the ninth gestational week and continues beyond birth. This protracted developmental timeline makes the human cerebellum particularly vulnerable to insult, especially during 24\u201340\u00a0weeks of gestation, when massive neurogenesis in the EGL causes a fivefold increase in size of the cerebellum [ 364 ]. Thus, while several malformations have a genetic basis, inflammation, fetal hemorrhage, and prematurity are often contributing factors. Here, we discuss some of the common and best understood human cerebellar malformations and their causes. Dandy Walker Malformation (DWM) is the most common human cerebellar malformation with an estimated incidence of 1/3000 live births [ 365 , 366 ]. DWM is an imaging diagnosis characterized by an enlarged posterior fossa, cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, and an enlarged fourth ventricle (Fig. 14 a). DWM can occur in association with agenesis of the corpus callosum, but more often occurs as an isolated finding on MRI scans. DWM clinical features are variable. Patients may exhibit symptoms ranging from intellectual disability to autism or they may be completely unaware of any deficits until diagnosed as adults for unrelated reasons [ 367 \u2013 369 ]. The genetic causes of DWM remain largely unknown. However, recent studies indicate that deletions in FOXC1 and ZIC1 / 4 are responsible for a small subset of DWM cases [ 370 , 371 ]. Prenatal cerebellar hemorrhage however can also cause DWM [ 372 ], which may also be associated with genetic risk factors; however, these have yet to be determined. Research in animal models has led to the hypothesis that disruptions of posterior fossa signaling from the mesenchyme surrounding the brain to the underlying embryonic cerebellum are key. Signaling disruptions cause dramatic reductions in cerebellar anlage neuronal progenitor proliferation, as well as abnormal migration of both RL- and VZ-derived cells. This ultimately leads to foliation and lamination defects [ 370 , 373 ]. Joubert syndrome and related disorders (JSRD) is a group of disorders with an incidence of 1 in 80,000\u2013100,000 live births [ 374 , 375 ]. JSRD is characterized by cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, thick and abnormally oriented superior cerebellar peduncles, and a deep interpeduncular fossa, all of which give it the pathognomonic Molar Tooth Sign (MTS) seen in axial brain scan images ([ 376 ], Fig. 14 d). Patients with JSRD exhibit variable neurological symptoms such as ataxia, developmental delay, abnormal eye movements, and altered breathing patterns. To date, ~23 genes have been identified as causative for JSRD [ 377 , 378 ]. Most have been linked to the primary cilia and its function, bringing JSRD under the umbrella of a highly heterogeneous group of disorders called ciliopathies. Studies in animal models as well as human fetal tissue from JSRD patients indicate reduced GC proliferation suggesting impaired SHH signaling ([ 290 , 291 , 379 ]: see \u201c Extrinsic Regulators of Cerebellar Development: The Role of Sonic Hedgehog \u201d section). Additionally, the primary cilia also plays a role in the mediation of signaling pathways involving WNT and platelet-derived growth factor which can impact cerebellar anlage fusion earlier in fetal development [ 380 , 381 ]. Cerebellar hypoplasia (CH) refers to underdevelopment of the cerebellum. This category of cerebellar malformation is distinct from DWM, as it does not involve a concomitant enlargement of the posterior fossa. CH is also an extremely heterogeneous group of disorders, and often, other CNS abnormalities are observed, including lissencephaly, microcephaly, and cortical heterotopia. CH may be unilateral, global, vermian, or ponto-cerebellar, where in addition to the cerebellum, the volume of the pons is also reduced likely reflecting the common developmental origin of GCs and pontine nuclei neurons in the cerebellar RL ([ 20 , 382 ], Fig. 14 b, e). In contrast to DWM, almost all individuals exhibit cognitive and motor impairments. Several genes have been associated with CH including mutations in CASK , DAB1 , OPHN1 , RELN , CHD7 , several tubulin genes, and several TSEN genes [ 209 , 383 \u2013 392 ]. Each causes developmental defects in a multitude of cerebellar developmental programs, including progenitor proliferation and neuronal migration and even developmental cell survival. Notably, CH can also occur due to a variety of non-genetic causes such as perinatal cytomegalovirus infection and perinatal exposure to alcohol and drugs such as cocaine [ 393 \u2013 397 ]. Cerebellar agenesis is an extremely rare anomaly distinguished by a complete or near-complete absence of the cerebellum ([ 398 ]; Fig. 14 c). Individuals show a number of neurological deficits particularly related to movement and speech, but can be otherwise surprisingly unaffected [ 399 ]. Homozygous mutations in PTF1A have been associated cerebellar agenesis in humans [ 400 ]. In mice, Ptf1a is required for the generation of all VZ-derived GABAergic cerebellar neurons. Failure to generate these neurons means that RL-derived cells have no trophic support and these too are therefore lost, resulting in cerebellar agenesis in neonates [ 34 ]. Fetal hemorrhages that completely disrupt the early cerebellar anlage have also been predicted to cause cerebellar agenesis [ 401 ]. Recent developments in neuropathology and neuroimaging have tremendously improved the diagnosis of developmental disorders of the cerebellum. Several genes responsible for these heterogeneous malformations have been identified and animal models have revealed novel developmental mechanisms of interest to both clinical and basic science. A deeper appreciation of the cellular and signaling mechanisms responsible for these malformations will enable improved diagnosis and potential treatment of these disorders. The importance of T3 and T4 in brain development has been well documented [ 402 , 403 ]. Deficiency of TH during fetal and early postnatal period results in severe mental retardation, known as cretinism in humans [ 404 ]. Since there is a distinct \u201ccritical period\u201d of TH action in brain development, replacement of TH should be started as early as possible to prevent irreversible neurological disorders. T4 enters the brain through the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) more easily than T3, an active form of TH [ 405 ]. After crossing the BBB, T4 is taken up by astrocytes and deiodinated to produce T3 by type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase [ 406 ]. T3 is then transferred to neurons or oligodendrocytes, possibly via monocarboxylate transporter 8 [ 407 ]. TH effects are mainly exerted through the nuclear TH receptor (TR; TR\u03b11, TR\u03b21, and TR\u03b22), a ligand-dependent transcription factor [ 408 ]. TR binds to specific DNA enhancer sequences known as the TH-response elements located in the promoter region of target genes [ 408 ]. The rodent cerebellum is a good model to investigate the TH action. This is partly because the rodent cerebellar development occurs largely postnatally, allowing cerebellar TH status to be precisely manipulated at various developmental stages [ 402 ]. Perinatal hypothyroidism dramatically affects morphogenesis [ 402 , 403 ]: the growth, dendrite arborization, and dendrite spine formation of PCs are all markedly decreased; synaptogenesis between PCs and PFs is dramatically repressed; the disappearance of the EGL is postponed as a result of the delayed proliferation and migration of GCs into the GL [ 409 ]. TRs are expressed in the most subsets of cells in the developing cerebellum [ 410 ]. TR\u03b11 is abundant in GCs, whereas TR\u03b21 is mainly expressed in PCs. The expression of many cerebellar genes is altered by perinatal hypothyroidism [ 403 ]. Representative TH-responsive genes in the cerebellum include neurotrophins such as nerve growth factor, BDNF, NT3, and NT-4/5, and receptors such as the inositol trisphosphate 3 receptor, and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor \u03b1, hairless, and myelin basic protein [ 411 , 412 ]. The expression of many of these genes is regulated by TH only during a limited period of development. (It should be noted, however, that although TH action in the brain is greater during development, TR levels are greater in the adult brain: [ 413 ].) Thus, TH sensitivity may be controlled by other unknown epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modification. Various animal models have been used to study TH in cerebellar development [ 414 ]. Interestingly, TR\u03b1 knock-out mice, TR\u03b2 knock-out mice and TR\u03b1/TR\u03b2 double knock-out mice do not display obvious cerebellar defects, suggesting that most of the consequences of congenital hypothyroidism in the brain are due to the detrimental activity of unliganded TR. This hypothesis is supported by studies of transgenic animals expressing mutant TR, which show severe neurodevelopmental defects [ 415 , 416 ]. Although these animal models have contributed greatly to our understanding on the role of TR in cerebellar development, these may not sufficiently address the mechanisms of direct TH action. Since TH acts not only in the brain but also in the peripheral organs, brain development may be affected by peripheral metabolic changes. Thus, cell or organ-specific inhibition/activation of TH action is required. For such purpose, Fauquier et al. [ 417 ] used a L7/Pcp2 promoter to generate transgenic mice that express a mutant TR\u03b11 specifically in PCs after P8. Probably because the timing of transgene expression is slightly after the critical period, this mouse showed only limited alterations in cerebellar morphogenesis. On the other hand, by Ptf1a-Cre recombination, mutant TR\u03b11 was expressed in PCs and GABAergic INs from prenatal stages, showing the alteration of PC morphogenesis [ 417 ]. We have also generated a transgenic mouse using mutant human TR\u03b21 with L7 / Pcp2 promoter (Fig. 15 ; [ 418 ]). Expression of mutant TR\u03b21 was observed as early as P2. This mouse showed decreased PC dendritic arborization and lower levels of expression of TH-regulated genes in PCs. To our surprise, GC migration was also retarded and the expression of TH-regulated genes in GCs and oligodendrocytes was also decreased. As a possible consequence, this mouse shows cerebellar ataxia. These studies indicate that TH may mainly act through TR in the PC to regulate the whole cerebellar development. Additional factors that transmit TH signaling in PCs to other subsets of cells are required. Furthermore, although it is usually considered that the critical period for TH action in the rodent cerebellum is the first two postnatal weeks, the actual critical period may be earlier. Disruption of TH action by environmental factors during the critical period may produce adverse effects [ 419 ]. The cerebellar ataxias comprise a heterogeneous group of neurological disorders characterized by gait disturbances, motor incoordination and imbalance, dysarthria, and oculomotor deficits [ 420 , 421 ]. The etiology of cerebellar ataxia is complex and includes acquired causes as well as a steadily growing number of inherited conditions [ 421 \u2013 423 ]. The genetic ataxias are usually progressive. For many of these disorders, pathologic changes in PCs and a substantial loss of these neurons resulting in cerebellar atrophy are thought to cause the symptoms of the disease. However, accumulating evidence from cell- and animal-based models of cerebellar ataxia suggest that abnormal PC development and related early changes in PC physiology might contribute to the disease, thus challenging our view of cerebellar ataxias as pure neurodegenerative disorders. Here, I briefly review the emerging concept that PC developmental abnormalities might be contributing to disease pathogenesis in cerebellar ataxia. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the Ataxin1 ( ATXN1 ) gene and is one of the most intensely studied dominant ataxias. Numerous mouse and other animal models have been generated for SCA1 that recapitulate different aspects of the human disease. For example, both transgenic mice overexpressing expanded ATXN1 [ 82Q ] as well as knock-in mice ( SCA1 154Q/2Q ) exhibit motor impairments and PC degeneration [ 424 ]. Interestingly, transgenic mice in which expression of the expanded transgene is delayed until well after the cerebellum has matured display a much reduced disease phenotype, suggesting that mutant ATXN1 interacts with a pathway involved in PC development [ 425 ]. Indeed, the same study demonstrated a key interaction of ATXN1 with retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptor \u03b1 (ROR\u03b1), a transcription factor critical for cerebellar development. Moreover, ROR\u03b1 expression levels were found to be reduced in the ATXN1 [ 82Q ] model [ 425 ]. Taken together, the results of this landmark study provided the first functional genetic evidence that compromising PC development contributes to the severity of neurodegeneration. Subsequent studies have shown that SCA1 transgenic mice display abnormalities in PC development, including a reduction of CF translocation along the developing dendritic tree and decreased pruning of CF terminals from the PC soma [ 426 , 427 ]. Similarly, profound impairments in PC dendritogenesis, spine development, and synaptogenesis have been described in the staggerer mouse [ 428 , 429 ], which harbors an autosomal recessive mutation in the Rora gene encoding ROR\u03b1, and is viewed by some as an extreme model of SCA1 [ 429 ]. Other studies have demonstrated similar PC developmental abnormalities in different mouse models of degenerative cerebellar ataxias. A PC-specific transgenic mouse model that expresses a truncated form of expanded human Ataxin-3, the disease protein causing SCA3, displays disarrangement of PCs and poor PC dendritic arborization [ 430 , 431 ]. As described above for SCA1, the PCs in this SCA3 model express decreased levels of the developmental transcription factor ROR\u03b1 [ 431 ], suggesting a potential molecular link between the observed developmental abnormalities in both models. Impaired dendritic arborization of PCs as well as abnormal spine morphogenesis have also been described in mice lacking \u03b2 -III spectrin, a model of SCA5 [ 432 ]. Similarly, cultured PCs overexpressing PKC\u03b3 with SCA14-causing mutations after adenoviral infection display a decreased dendritic arbor as well as decreased spine density [ 433 ]. In vivo lentiviral-mediated expression of mutant PKC\u03b3 in PCs led to impaired pruning of CF synapses from developing PCs, although no dendritic abnormalities were observed [ 434 ]. However, the recently reported transgenic SCA14 mouse model shows abnormal dendritic development of PCs both in vivo as well as in organotypic slice cultures [ 435 ]. Besides models of the human SCAs, several other genetic mouse mutants have highlighted the relationship between abnormal PC development and ataxia. For example, the ataxic Moonwalker ( Mwk ) mouse harbors a dominant gain-of-function mutation in the TRPC3 ion channel, resulting in adult-onset PC loss but also impairments in PC dendritic arborization during cerebellar development [ 436 ]. TRPC3 is a key player in the mGluR1 signaling pathway vital for PC function [ 437 , 438 ]. Interestingly, impaired mGluR1 signaling has been demonstrated in a number of the mouse models described above including SCA1 [ 439 , 440 ], SCA3 [ 441 ], and SCA5 [ 442 ] models. Future research should help to clarify whether there is a causal relationship between impaired mGluR1 signaling at PC-PF synapses and developmental PC abnormalities in these and other models of ataxia. In summary, PC developmental abnormalities are clearly evident in a wide range of ataxic mouse mutants including models of the degenerative SCAs. The observed PC developmental defects commonly include impaired dendritic arborization, resulting in synaptic deficits affecting CF and PF connections and ultimately altering PC physiology. It will be important to better understand the underlying\u2014likely common\u2014molecular mechanisms by which mutations in distinct genes cause abnormal PC development and function. These could offer attractive future therapeutic targets to alleviate motor dysfunction in cerebellar ataxia. MB is the most common pediatric brain tumor and is the most common cause of pediatric death from cancer. Histologically, cases are classified into classic, nodular/desmoplastic, and large cell/anaplastic subtype [ 443 ], and prognosis is performed by combining histological subtype, clinical markers, namely, age, metastatic stage, and level of resection, as well as selected molecular markers. Morphologically, MB cells closely resemble GCs and GCPs; hence, it has been long postulated that a link exists between these tumors and the normal development of the cerebellum. Evidence gained from candidate gene approaches in mouse models and more recently \u201c-omics\u201d screening of large tumor series has shown deregulation of specific developmental pathways in subgroups of these tumors. The current consensus is that MB can be sub-classified based on genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic characteristics [ 444 , 445 ] into four distinct subgroups (Fig. 16 ): WNT, SHH, Group 3, and Group 4 [ 445 ]. The WNT and SHH subgroups have been associated with constitutive activation of the WNT/\u03b2-catenin and SHH pathways, respectively, whereas Group 3 and Group 4 MBs are less well characterized. Each of these subgroups have defining demographic, clinical, genetic, and epigenetic profiles, and emerging evidence links their origin to different cerebellar progenitor cells at different developmental time points. Here, we will summarize the key features of the current molecular stratification of MB from a developmental oncobiology perspective. GCPs are the main cell of origin of SHH-MB, as shown in mouse models in which Ptch1 is conditionally inactivated in GCPs. Importantly, constitutive activation of SHH signaling induces neoplastic transformation of more undifferentiated progenitor cells only upon commitment toward a GC lineage [ 446 ]. Pre-neoplastic lesions expressed Atho1 , a marker of the GC lineage, and showed activation of Gli1 , Cyclin D1 , and MycN , which are SHH target genes. Their gene expression profiles were more similar (differing by 34 genes) to tumor cells than GCPs (differing by 75 genes) [ 447 ]. SHH-MBs have also been shown to originate from cells located in the cochlear nuclei of the brainstem [ 448 ]. MRI studies have shown differences in the location of MB subgroups, and MB location (as well as enhancement pattern) can predict the molecular subgroup of pediatric MBs. SHH tumors are mainly detected within the cerebellar hemispheres [ 449 \u2013 451 ] consistent with a GCP cell of origin. Moreover, in a series of 63 human MBs that were morphologically nodular/desmoplastic, a histological subtype likely to be typical of the SHH subgroup [ 452 ], 33\u00a0% had very close contact to the cochlear nuclei on MRI [ 448 ]. Human Shh MBs [ 445 ] have a 1:1 male-to-female ratio and a bimodal age distribution (very frequently seen in infants and adults), with a good prognosis in infants but an intermediate prognosis in other age groups. All histological nodular/desmoplastic MBs are likely SHH-MBs [ 452 ], but 50\u00a0% of SHH-MBs are of other morphology. Mouse models have shown that WNT-MBs, characterized by activating mutations in the Wnt pathway effector CTNNB1, arise from cells outside the cerebellum, in the embryonic dorsal brainstem [ 449 ]. These studies also showed that the genes characterizing human WNT-MBs are more often expressed in the lower RL and embryonic dorsal brainstem than in the upper RL of the developing cerebellum. In addition, transcriptome analysis showed that the MBs arising in these mice matched human WNT-MBs. MRI studies in patients have shown that WNT tumors are often found within the fourth ventricle (cerebellar peduncle/cerebellopontine angle cistern) and infiltrated the dorsal brainstem [ 449 , 450 ], with the majority of them being continuous with the cuneate nucleus [ 451 ], a region that corresponds to the origin defined for the murine WNT-MBs described above. Human WNT-MBs [ 445 ] have a 1:1 male-to-female ratio and occur at all ages (uncommon in infants). They have a very good long-term prognosis in comparison to the other subgroups of MB (survival rate likely exceeds 90\u00a0% with current treatment). The large majority of WNT-MBs investigated so far have classic histology. Cerebellar stem cells are a third likely cell of origin for human MBs. Models using Rb + Tp53 mutant mice were generated where MBs developed from neural stem cells in the cerebellar white matter [ 453 , 454 ]. These tumors resembled human Group 3 MBs histologically while expressing high levels of neural stem cell markers (Nestin, Sox2, and Sox9). A further model using Myc + Tp53 mutant mice developed MBs from cerebellar neural stem cells and from GCPs, although the tumors that formed from GCPs lost their lineage specific markers first [ 455 ]. This model expressed high levels of neural stem cell genes and also resembled human Group 3 tumors at a histological and molecular level. In the MRI studies to date, Group 3 and Group 4 MBs are characterized by brainstem contact with most of the tumors growing within the vermis. Most also contact both the cochlear and cuneate nuclei and always infiltrate the fourth ventricle [ 450 , 451 ]. Group 3 MBs [ 445 ] are seen more frequently in males than females and almost never in adults, have a poor prognosis, and are frequently metastatic. Group 3 MBs most frequently have a classic morphology, but the Group 3 subgroup contains the majority of the large cell/anaplastic tumors. Group 4 comprises 30\u00a0% of MBs and it is the least well characterized molecularly. At present, it is also unclear from which cells these tumors originate. This subgroup has a male-to-female ratio of 2:1 and has an intermediate prognosis, similar to the SHH subgroup [ 445 ]. Group 3 and Group 4 MBs share some molecular features: amplification of the OTX2 oncogene, which is not seen in the other subgroups, and isochromosome 17q (26\u00a0% in Group 3 and 66\u00a0% in Group 4 MBs [ 447 ]). However, there are also important differences. Group 3 MBs show high levels of MYC, and often gain of chromosome 1q and/or loss of chromosome 5q and 10q, whereas Group 4 MBs have low levels of MYC and MYCN and loss of the X chromosome in 80\u00a0% of females within the subgroup [ 445 ]. In summary, \u201c-omics\u201d datasets on large series of MB combined with the results of ontogeny studies performed in mouse models aiming at characterizing the cell of origin of the various subgroups together with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in patients lend additional support to the notion that MB is in fact a disease arising from deregulated cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the development and homeostasis of the cerebellum. The goal of our consensus paper is to provide an updated view of our current knowledge on cerebellar development. The broad spectrum of the work reviewed in such a short format leaves little room for specific debate. Nevertheless, many of the concepts reported here have already reached consensus. The seminal discovery of the \u201cisthmic organizer\u201d and its inductive role has led to an understanding of the molecular regionalization of the neural tube with its precise frontiers between domains expressing homeobox-containing genes. The interface between caudal GBX2 and rostral OTX2 expressing domains marks the location of the \u201cisthmic organizer\u201d which, through Fgf8 secretion, initiates the molecular cascade required for the specification of cerebellum. Next come the germinal epithelia of the cerebellum. For over a century, the cerebellum was known for the dual origins of its neuronal populations: the VZ and the RL. However, the categories of neurons generated in each of these epithelia have only recently been established. Genetic fate mapping proved that glutamatergic neurons (most of the CN neurons, and all GCs and UBCs), specified by the transcription factor ATOH1, originate from the RL and migrate via the EGL. In contrast, GABAergic neurons (PCs, ML INs, Lugaro and Golgi cells, and GABAergic neurons of the CN), specified by PTF1a, originate from the VZ. Moreover, both neuroepithelia are divided into subdomains, each one specified by distinct transcription factors to generate the corresponding population of neurons. Following specification comes neuronal migration and differentiation. Despite recent progress, the data are less complete. For example, broad areas of the early development of PCs remain obscure, even while later events such as dendritogenesis are well understood. Our knowledge on the mechanisms leading to the biochemical heterogeneity of PCs and their aggregation into longitudinal and transverse compartments has improved: there is a dichotomy among PCs, those born between E10\u00a0and E11.5 will become ZII + and those born later will be ZII \u2212 , indicating that specification might exist among progenitors. Related to PC compartmentalization, the formation of circuit topography and the elimination of CF multiple innervation opens the vast domain of synaptogenesis and the role of functional activity in the fine-tuning of the cortical circuit\u2019s specificity\u2014a chapter that, at this moment, remains little explored and is an anticipated topic for future consensus papers. Similarly, the ways in which cerebellar INs and glia become integrated into the mature cerebellum are also beginning to be understood. Finally, in parallel with these events, we are now seeing how the development of the characteristic cerebellar foliation fits into the picture. We have also updated on the role of the TH (a cerebellists\u2019 old friend because of its multiple effects on cerebellar development) describing recent advances using transgenic animals with conditional nuclear TH receptor knock-outs targeted to PCs or/and IN that allow for the suppression of secondary effects on other neurons or peripheral organs. Finally, our review has briefly touched upon cerebellar pathology. For example, the analysis of the role of SHH, secreted by PCs as mitogen for GC proliferation, provides a basis for better understanding of the origins of MBs, and inherited disorders of cerebellar development can now be placed in a stronger developmental context. In conclusion, following the outline proposed by Ferdinando Rossi in his planned monograph, the data presented here provide our brief consensus of the current knowledge on cerebellar development.", "title": "Consensus Paper: Cerebellar Development."}, "annotated_text": {"abstract": "The development of the mammalian <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> is orchestrated by both cell-autonomous programs and inductive environmental influences.

The description of morphogenetic regulatory processes at specific locations of the developing neural primordium has led to the concept of secondary organizers, which regulate the identity and regional polarity of neighboring neuroepithelial regions [ 2 ]. These organizers usually develop within the previously broadly regionalized neuroectoderm with defined genetic boundaries. Their subsequent activity refines local neural identities along the anteroposterior or dorsoventral axes, thus regionalizing the anterior neural plate and neural tube [ 3 , 4 ].

The differential orientation and polarity of the <entity uuid=\"94174abc-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">FGF8</entity> signal seems to be directly dependent on the spatial position of <entity uuid=\"94174abc-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">FGF8</entity>-related secondary organizers and on the activity of the negative modulators <entity uuid=\"73595946-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">MKP3</entity>, <entity uuid=\"343c8b8c-cbec-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">SEF</entity>, and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">sprouty1/2</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">SPRY1/2</entity>). <entity uuid=\"94174abc-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">FGF8</entity> may also translocate into the <entity uuid=\"7f79e0aa-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">nucleus</entity>, and this nuclear <entity uuid=\"94174abc-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">FGF8</entity> may function as a transcriptional regulator to induce <entity uuid=\"18308f88-cbec-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Spry2</entity> in the isthmus independently of ERK <entity uuid=\"606a17a2-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">phosphorylation</entity>.

At <entity uuid=\"4c94c17e-4a37-4dc7-bf5a-db7c8aa4e7d8\" type=\"CellLine\">E9</entity>, following territorial specification and the closure of the neural tube, murine cerebellar <entity uuid=\"5fb5054c-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">histogenesis</entity> begins with the specification of cerebellar progenitors. Several studies have demonstrated that all cerebellar cells are generated by the neuroepithelium of the alar plate of <entity uuid=\"78a313ac-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">r1</entity> [ 19 \u2013 22 ]. Conversely, the most dorsal region of <entity uuid=\"78a313ac-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">r1</entity> gives rise to the roof plate, which produces cells of the <entity uuid=\"784346c0-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">choroid plexus</entity> [ 23 ]. All cerebellar neurons are produced in the alar plate of <entity uuid=\"78a313ac-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">r1</entity> that is located <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">rostrally</entity> adjacent to the isthmus. In this region, the dorsalmost part of the neuroepithelium gives rise to the roof plate while the ventrally and intermediately located parts become the <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">ventricular zone</entity> (<entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity>) and the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">rhombic lip</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity>). Recent genetic and viral lineage tracing studies have clarified the origins and birthdates of distinct subtypes of cerebellar neurons. Cerebellar glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons are generated from the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity> and the <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity> respectively. In mice, glutamatergic neurons in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">cerebellar nuclei</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CN</entity>) leave the cerebellar <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity> at early stages (E10.5\u201312.5) and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCs</entity> at middle to late stages (E13.5 onward) [ 24 \u2013 26 ]. <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">Unipolar brush cells</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity>) are known to emerge at relatively late developmental stages [ 27 ]. In mice, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> are born at E10.5\u2013E13.5, GABAergic <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">interneurons</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity>) in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CN</entity> at E10.5\u2013<entity uuid=\"f49302fe-37ca-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">E11</entity>.5, and Golgi cells at approximately E13.5\u2013postnatal (peak around E14\u2013E16) [ 28 \u2013 31 ]. Late-born GABAergic <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity>, including stellate and basket cells, derive from secondary precursors in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">prospective white matter</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PWM</entity>) at later stages (from E13 to P5 with a peak around birth) [ 32 , 33 ]. Thus, cerebellar neuronal subtypes depend on when and where they are generated from neural progenitors. This leads to the idea that cerebellar progenitors with their own spatial and temporal identities produce specific neuronal subtypes. Two <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">basic-helix-loop-helix</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">bHLH</entity>) proteins, <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ATHO1</entity> (also called <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">MATH1</entity>) and <entity uuid=\"148e967a-cbee-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">PTF1a</entity>, participate in the specification of the spatial identities of cerebellar progenitors. <entity uuid=\"fe7a0e2c-cbe9-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Atoh1</entity> is expressed in the progenitors of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity>, and targeted <entity uuid=\"fe7a0e2c-cbe9-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Atoh1</entity> disruption results in the loss of glutamatergic neurons in the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> [ 24 \u2013 26 ].

Furthermore, mis-expression of <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ATHO1</entity> and <entity uuid=\"148e967a-cbee-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">PTF1a</entity> in the <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity> and the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity> results in the ectopic production of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, respectively [ 36 ].

Consistent with this view, <entity uuid=\"fe7a0e2c-cbe9-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Atoh1</entity> expression ectopically expands into the <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity> in <entity uuid=\"148e967a-cbee-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Ptf1a</entity> mutants [ 35 , 36 ]. However, ectopic <entity uuid=\"148e967a-cbee-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Ptf1a</entity> expression is not observed in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity> of <entity uuid=\"fe7a0e2c-cbe9-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Atoh1</entity> mutants [ 36 ], suggesting that <entity uuid=\"148e967a-cbee-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">PTF1a</entity> suppresses the expression of <entity uuid=\"fe7a0e2c-cbe9-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Atoh1</entity> but the converse is not physiologically true in the cerebellar primordium. In contrast to the <entity uuid=\"cdf529ec-d8ff-11e7-b4fd-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellType\">GABAergic neuron</entity> progenitors in the <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity>, the machinery to specify cerebellar <entity uuid=\"cdf95b0c-d8ff-11e7-b4fd-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellType\">glutamatergic neuron</entity> subtypes remains elusive. However, even when glutamatergic neurons are ectopically produced from the <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity> by ectopic expression of <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ATHO1</entity>, the generation of neuronal types follows the temporal schedule of the normal glutamatergic neurons derived from the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity> [ 36 ]. This suggests that, as for <entity uuid=\"cdf529ec-d8ff-11e7-b4fd-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellType\">GABAergic neuron</entity> progenitors, <entity uuid=\"cdf95b0c-d8ff-11e7-b4fd-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellType\">glutamatergic neuron</entity> progenitors in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity> may change their temporal identities from \u201cglutamatergic <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CN</entity> <entity uuid=\"cde9b2e2-d8ff-11e7-b4fd-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellType\">neuron</entity>-producing type\u201d to \u201c<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GC</entity>/<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBC</entity>-producing type\u201d during development (Fig. 2 ).

This suggests that <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCs</entity> and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity> may be produced from distinct progenitors in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity>, although some cells in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity> are found to express both markers (see also \u201c <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">Unipolar brush cells</entity> \u201d section). Because the loss of the roof plate or targeted disruption of genes expressed in the roof plate affects the morphology and the nature of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity> [ 23 , 44 , 45 ], extrinsic factors from the roof plate may also play important roles to regulate the identities of <entity uuid=\"cdf95b0c-d8ff-11e7-b4fd-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellType\">glutamatergic neuron</entity> progenitors in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity>. Cerebellar GABAergic neurons can be categorized into two subtypes: <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> and <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">Pax-2</entity> + <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity>. Each subtype is generated from a distinct progenitor in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">VZ:PC progenitors</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCPs</entity>) and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">Pax-2 + IN progenitors</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PIPs</entity>). At the early stages, only a small number of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PIPs</entity> are located in the rostralmost region of the <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity> and a large number of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCPs</entity> occupy the remaining regions in the <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity>.

[ 88 ] found that <entity uuid=\"6813ca98-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NFI</entity> occupancy in pre-migratory <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCs</entity>, prior to departure from the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">EGL</entity> and arrival in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GL</entity>, is inhibited by <entity uuid=\"84b71524-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoFunction\">binding</entity> of the trans -repressor <entity uuid=\"d3e57474-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">REST</entity> to the <entity uuid=\"a1ad6346-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Gabra6</entity> promoter. <entity uuid=\"d3e57474-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">REST</entity> expression and <entity uuid=\"83d9edd4-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoFunction\">DNA binding</entity> decline as <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCPs</entity> initiate differentiation, and knockdown of <entity uuid=\"d3e57474-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">REST</entity> selectively enhances the onset of <entity uuid=\"a1ad6346-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Gabra6</entity> expression and its <entity uuid=\"84b71524-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoFunction\">binding</entity> by <entity uuid=\"6813ca98-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NFI</entity> at early, but not later, developmental times [ 88 ]. Thus, <entity uuid=\"d3e57474-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">REST</entity> is an early repressor of <entity uuid=\"6813ca98-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NFI</entity> occupancy, preventing premature onset of <entity uuid=\"6813ca98-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NFI</entity> <entity uuid=\"84b71524-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoFunction\">binding</entity> to the <entity uuid=\"a1ad6346-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Gabra6 gene</entity> in pre-migratory <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCs</entity> within the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">EGL</entity>. Since <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GC</entity> <entity uuid=\"7fcf3adc-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">dendrite</entity>/<entity uuid=\"8069818c-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">synapse</entity> formation takes place within the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GL</entity> additional, post-migratory mechanisms must also be involved in the timing of <entity uuid=\"6813ca98-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NFI</entity> occupancy. Recent studies identified an <entity uuid=\"6813ca98-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NFI</entity> developmental \u201cswitch\u201d program operating in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCs</entity> maturing within the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GL</entity> [ 91 ]. This program consists mainly of several hundred <entity uuid=\"6813ca98-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NFI</entity>-regulated genes expressed with two distinct time frames: \u201cearly\u201d genes downregulated by <entity uuid=\"6813ca98-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NFI</entity> as the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GL</entity> matures, and \u201clate,\u201d temporally upregulated genes associated with mature <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCs</entity> that are activated by <entity uuid=\"6813ca98-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NFI</entity> [ 91 ]. Importantly, many late-expressed genes participate in <entity uuid=\"7fcf3adc-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">dendrite</entity>/<entity uuid=\"8069818c-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">synapse</entity> formation and function, directly implicating the <entity uuid=\"6813ca98-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NFI</entity> switch program as an essential component of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GC</entity> <entity uuid=\"659f8824-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">synaptic maturation</entity>. As observed for <entity uuid=\"a1ad6346-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Gabra6</entity> , a central feature of the <entity uuid=\"6813ca98-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NFI</entity> switch program is delayed <entity uuid=\"6813ca98-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NFI</entity> occupancy of late genes as <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCs</entity> mature [ 91 ]. So what regulates <entity uuid=\"6813ca98-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NFI</entity> temporal <entity uuid=\"84b71524-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoFunction\">binding</entity> of late genes within the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GL</entity>? Resting <entity uuid=\"7fb3fb50-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">membrane</entity> potential is more depolarized in immature <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCs</entity> and becomes hyperpolarized as the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GL</entity> matures [ 92 ]. Maintaining cerebellar tissue in a depolarizing medium prevents the maturation of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GC</entity> dendrites in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GL</entity> [ 92 ]. This depolarization block involves activation of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">VGCCs</entity>) and the Ca 2+ -dependent stimulation of <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">calcineurin</entity> phosphatase, which inhibits a <entity uuid=\"5fe6bd1c-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">gene expression</entity> switch [ 93 ]. Voltage-driven mechanisms also regulate the <entity uuid=\"6813ca98-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NFI</entity> switch [ 91 ]. Importantly, depolarization blocks <entity uuid=\"6813ca98-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NFI</entity> temporal occupancy of late genes via activation of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">VGCCs</entity> and <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">calcineurin</entity> [ 91 ]. <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">Calcineurin</entity> activity is elevated in the immature <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> and declines with development, consistent with its inhibitory role during <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GC</entity> dendritogenesis in vivo [ 91 ]. <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">Calcineurin</entity> promotes <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">NFAT</entity> nuclear <entity uuid=\"65093018-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">localization</entity>, and <entity uuid=\"677a0278-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NFATc4</entity> mediates the actions of <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">calcineurin</entity> on the <entity uuid=\"6813ca98-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NFI</entity> switch by <entity uuid=\"84b71524-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoFunction\">binding</entity> to late genes in immature <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCs</entity> and repressing <entity uuid=\"6813ca98-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NFI</entity> occupancy [ 91 ]. This led to a model in which declining <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">calcineurin</entity> activity and resultant <entity uuid=\"677a0278-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NFATc4</entity> departure from late genes in the maturing <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GL</entity> becomes permissive for the onset of <entity uuid=\"6813ca98-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NFI</entity> temporal <entity uuid=\"84b71524-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoFunction\">binding</entity> and <entity uuid=\"6813ca98-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NFI</entity> switch programming (Fig. 4 ). <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">Calcineurin</entity> also inhibits <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GC</entity> dendritogenesis via the repressor <entity uuid=\"1f56b482-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">MEF2A</entity> [ 94 ]. Thus, transcriptional de-repression plays an important role in initiating <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GC</entity> <entity uuid=\"7fcf3adc-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">dendrite</entity> formation. Finally, late-expressed trans - activators (e.g., <entity uuid=\"886d14c6-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">ETV1</entity> [ 95 ]) also may control the timing of <entity uuid=\"6813ca98-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NFI</entity> <entity uuid=\"84b71524-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoFunction\">binding</entity> and dendritogenesis in the developing <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GL</entity>, subsequent to <entity uuid=\"677a0278-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NFATc4</entity> departure (Fig. 4 ). This may provide greater flexibility in the temporal expression and function of distinct gene subsets during <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GC</entity> dendritogenesis-<entity uuid=\"5f4da32a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">synaptogenesis</entity>. <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity> are a class of small excitatory <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> associated with the cerebellar cortex and cerebellar-like structures [ 96 \u2013 100 ]. They are especially enriched in the flocculonodular lobules of\u00a0the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> [ 100 , 101 ] and the dorsal cochlear <entity uuid=\"7f79e0aa-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">nucleus</entity> [ 100 , 102 , 103 ], regions that process sensorimotor signals regulating <entity uuid=\"77e7982a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">head</entity>, body, and <entity uuid=\"77f898fa-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">eye</entity> position. Although our knowledge of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity> derives mainly from studies in rodents, the main features of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity> are highly conserved across species: <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity> are already recognized in teleosts and are found virtually unchanged in all mammals, including humans [ 100 , 104 \u2013 111 ]. A typical <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBC</entity> has a single thick <entity uuid=\"7fcf3adc-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">dendrite</entity> ending in a brush of fine dendrioles, which form a specialized giant <entity uuid=\"8069818c-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">synaptic junction</entity> with a single mossy fiber terminal (Fig. 5 a; [ 100 , 112 ]). <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBC</entity> axons branch locally within the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GL</entity> where they create an intrinsic mossy fiber system superimposed on the canonical extrinsic mossy fiber system [ 100 , 113 , 114 ]. All <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity> are characterized by these morphological features, yet they are classified into type I and type II <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity>, which represent two chemically and functionally distinct subclasses [ 102 , 115 , 116 ] that correspond to the previously identified <entity uuid=\"1fe70038-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">calretinin</entity> (<entity uuid=\"1fe70038-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">CR</entity>)-positive and <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">metabotropic glutamate receptor</entity> (<entity type=\"GeneProtein\">mGluR</entity>) 1\u03b1-positive <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity>, respectively [ 100 , 101 , 117 \u2013 121 ]. Birthdating studies with <entity type=\"Chemical\">bromodeoxyuridine</entity> labeling revealed that the two <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBC</entity> types are also generated within different although overlapping time windows [ 120 ]. In rats, type I <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity> are born around embryonic day E16\u201319 (~E14\u201317 in mouse) while type II <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity> are produced over a longer period of time extending from <entity uuid=\"54f96796-37cb-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">E18</entity> (in mouse E16) presumably to early postnatal days (P) 0\u20131. Initially, they were suggested to originate from a hotspot in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">EGL</entity> [ 122 ], but subsequent histological studies indicated a <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity> origin [ 123 ]. The definite origin of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity> was however revealed by genetic fate mapping studies. Englund and colleagues [ 27 ] using <entity uuid=\"82d683bc-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">TBR2</entity>, a T-domain transcription factor, as a marker showed that the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity>\u2014just as for the other glutamatergic neurons of the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> and cochlear <entity uuid=\"7f79e0aa-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">nucleus</entity> [ 25 , 26 ]\u2014originate from <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ATHO1</entity>-expressing progenitors of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity>. The <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBC</entity> progenitors also express <entity uuid=\"603b817a-cbec-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">WNT1</entity> early in development (E10.5\u201313.5), but the expression is downregulated before <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity> migrate from the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity> [ 124 ]. The newly generated <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity> remain in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity> for an additional 1\u20132\u00a0days after which they exit through a narrow channel and migrate to their final destination [ 27 , 38 , 125 ]. The cerebellar <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity> migrate dorsally through the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">white matter</entity> and avoid the cell masses of future <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CN</entity> neurons. Most <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity> reach the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GL</entity> by P10, several days before <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GC</entity> <entity uuid=\"613b1244-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">neurogenesis</entity> is complete [ 27 ]. The final differentiation of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity> occurs between <entity uuid=\"f2d46340-37ca-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">P2</entity> and P28. Morin et al. [ 126 ] divided the maturation of type I <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity> into four distinct stages based on the morphological appearance of the dendritic brush (the protodendritic, filopodial, intermediate brush, and dendriolar brush stages). In the last stage (P21\u2013P28), the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity> already exhibit mature <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBC</entity> morphology and, although their brush keeps expanding, it does so without qualitative changes in the dendriolar pattern. Unpublished data (Sekerkov\u00e1 et al.) suggest that <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">somato</entity>-dendritic differentiation of the two subtypes is also differentially regulated. In long-term organotypic cerebellar cultures (from P8 mice; 20\u201325\u00a0days in culture), only type II <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity> develop brushes while most of type I <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity> produce long, \u201cbranching\u201d dendrites (Fig. 5 b, c). Moreover, in vivo, type I <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity> undergo chemical changes (Fig. 5 d). Around the first postnatal week, a subset of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity> co-expresses both <entity uuid=\"1fe70038-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">CR</entity> (the marker of type I) and mGLUR1\u03b1 (the marker of type II <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity>) and fewer than 10\u00a0% of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity> express only <entity uuid=\"1fe70038-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">CR</entity>. By the third week, the number of double-labeled <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity> decreases dramatically (they virtually disappear by 2\u00a0months of age; [ 100 , 115 ]) and concomitantly the number of the purely <entity uuid=\"1fe70038-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">CR</entity>-positive <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity> increases (to ~33\u00a0% of total <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity>). This suggests different postnatal differentiation mechanisms for the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBC</entity> subtypes. The differentiation of the brush and the downregulation of mGLUR1\u03b1 in type I <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity> seem to coincide with the establishment of the first synaptic contacts with external mossy fibers (~<entity uuid=\"d21c4406-37ca-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">P12</entity>). GABAergic neurons of the cerebellar cortex comprise projection <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> and local <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity>. All these cells derive from progenitors pools (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCPs</entity> and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PIPs</entity>, respectively) located in different <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity> subregions (see \u201c Glutamatergic Phenotypes \u201d section). Morphologically, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCPs</entity> span the ventricular (apical) and pial (basal) surfaces of the cerebellar primordium, taking an elongated (neuroepithelial or radial glial) shape [ 127 ]. How <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCPs</entity> behave is not well understood: whether they divide symmetrically or asymmetrically, how they undergo <entity uuid=\"613d6760-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">interkinetic nuclear migration</entity>, and the morphology of newly generated <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> in the <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity> all remain unknown. Also, whether (and how) a single class of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCPs</entity> changes in a temporally regulated manner to generate the different <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> subclasses or whether <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCPs</entity> are inherently heterogeneous within <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity> needs to be studied. Nascent <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> from E14 in mice form a layer several cells thick called the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> plate [ 128 , 129 ]. This transient structure normally spreads through the presumptive cerebellar cortex until late embryonic days, followed by <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity>-monolayer formation during the early postnatal stage triggered by <entity uuid=\"d34023c0-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">RELN</entity> <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> (see \u201c Development of Cerebellar Compartmentation \u201d section). The supply of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> to the cortex occurs sequentially [ 129 , 130 ]. <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> generated at E10, especially ones born at the posterior <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity> close to the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity>, are the first to finish their migration and form the plate [ 131 , 132 ]. This may be because the distance between their birthplace and the goal is the least among the entire <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> population (no more than ~200\u00a0\u03bcm). <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> generated at <entity uuid=\"f49302fe-37ca-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">E11</entity> join the plate from <entity uuid=\"3ad6aa0c-e871-415e-a530-73d1d1adbfd7\" type=\"CellLine\">E15</entity>, followed by E12-born <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> from E16. These later-born <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> (as well as <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> generated anteriorly at E10) need to migrate over much longer distances than the posteriorly E10-born <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> (up to 700\u2013800\u00a0\u03bcm in mice). The early/posterior-born <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> take a tangential migratory route (which is parallel to the pial surface) until E13. They are characterized by long leading processes (100\u00a0\u03bcm or longer), which morphologically and molecularly resemble axons, and a much shorter trailing process containing the <entity uuid=\"7f87e222-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">Golgi apparatus</entity>. This tangential migration crosses radial glial fibers and is reminiscent of that exhibited by <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity>-derived cells. The initial departure of this early/posterior-born population from the <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity> and the subsequent tangential migration are normal in the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> of reeler mice. The early/posterior-born <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> then change orientation by sending the original Golgi-rich trailing process into the cortical region that intensely expresses <entity uuid=\"d34023c0-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">RELN</entity> (produced at E13 by <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity>-derived tangentially migrating cells of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">nuclear transitory zone</entity>, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">NTZ</entity>) [ 131 ]. This switchback-like, tangential-to-radial orientation change between E13 and E14 is strictly dependent on <entity uuid=\"d34023c0-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">RELN</entity>. These observations suggest a short-range action of <entity uuid=\"d34023c0-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">RELN</entity>. This model is supported by co-culture experiments showing that <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> (both normal and reeler -derived) will align in vitro along an artificial <entity uuid=\"d34023c0-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">RELN</entity>-rich zone [ 133 ]. However, transgenic reeler mice artificially expressing <entity uuid=\"d34023c0-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">RELN</entity> under the control of the <entity uuid=\"6647bc56-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">nestin</entity> promoter showed an apparently normal (rescued) arrangement of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> [ 134 ], suggesting that <entity uuid=\"d34023c0-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">RELN</entity> may regulate <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> <entity uuid=\"5f60847c-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">behavior</entity> in a context-dependent manner. In contrast to the posterior-born <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity>, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> born more anteriorly exhibit radially oriented somatal morphologies during migration. The close spatial relationship between these <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> somata and radial glial fibers supports the prevailing model that <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> migration is guided by radial glial fibers [ 129 , 135 ]. These radially oriented <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> at E12 or E13 have <entity uuid=\"7fcf1bba-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">axon</entity>-like fibers that ascend towards the pia [ 131 ], while post-migratory (late embryonic) <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> forming the plate have downward-directing axons [ 129 , 130 , 136 ]. Several points remain to be elucidated: how these anterior-born <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> proceed the mid-embryonic migration processes, whether these cells are also affected by dynamic changes of cellular orientation or polarity, and how <entity uuid=\"d34023c0-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">RELN</entity> contributes to <entity uuid=\"5fb5054c-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">histogenesis</entity> by these radially oriented <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity>. The fundamental architecture of the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> is an elaborate pattern of transverse zones and parasagittal stripes [ 137 , 138 ] that is highly reproducible between individuals and conserved across birds [ 139 , 140 ] and mammals (reviewed in [ 141 , 142 ]). Compartmentation is revealed by intrinsic differences between subsets of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> (e.g., <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">zebrin II</entity>/<entity type=\"GeneProtein\">aldolase C</entity> (<entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ZII</entity> [ 143 ]; <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">phospholipase C</entity> (<entity type=\"GeneProtein\">PLC</entity>) \u03b23/4 [ 144 ]; <entity uuid=\"db58329c-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">HSP25</entity> [ 145 ]), the restriction of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> (reviewed in [ 146 ]), patterns of pathological <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> death (reviewed in [ 147 ]), the phenotypes of multiple cerebellar mutants (e.g., lurcher ( Grid Lc )\u2014[ 148 ]; rostral cerebellar <entity type=\"Disease\">malformation</entity> ( <entity uuid=\"54e0635e-cbec-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Unc5c</entity> rcm )\u2014[ 149 ]; weaver ( <entity uuid=\"f834517a-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Kcnj6</entity> wv )\u2014[ 150 ]; <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">cerebellar deficient folia</entity> ( <entity uuid=\"57b104b4-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Ctnna2</entity> cdf )\u2014[ 151 ]), and the topography of afferent and efferent projections (reviewed in [ 152 ]). Cerebellar compartmentation appears to start at ~E10 in the <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity> of the fourth ventricle but not earlier, e.g., [ 153 \u2013 156 ]. <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> subtype specification likely occurs when <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> undergo terminal mitosis between E10 and E13 [ 54 ] in the <entity uuid=\"148e967a-cbee-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Ptf1a</entity> -expressing progenitor domain of the <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity> ([ 23 , 34 , 49 ]: see \u201c Glutamatergic Phenotypes \u201d section). Birthdating studies have identified two distinct <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> populations: an early-born cohort (E10\u2013<entity uuid=\"f49302fe-37ca-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">E11</entity>.5) destined to become <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">zebrin II</entity> (<entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ZII</entity>) + and a late-born cohort (<entity uuid=\"f49302fe-37ca-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">E11</entity>.5\u2013E13) destined to become <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ZII</entity> \u2212 . A direct correlation is also found between <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> birthdates and their adult stripe location, suggesting that both subtype specification (e.g., <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ZII</entity> + vs. <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ZII</entity> \u2212 ) and positional information (which zone or stripe) are acquired at this time, e.g., [ 30 , 157 \u2013 160 ]; both are <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity>-intrinsic and not activity- or afferent-dependent, e.g., [ 161 \u2013 164 ]. However, there is no reason to believe that individual <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> stripes have a clonal origin. During the same interval, the cerebellar <entity uuid=\"78b604c6-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">anlage</entity> undergoes a 90\u00b0 rotation, which converts the embryonic rostrocaudal axis into the mediolateral axis of the cerebellar primordium [ 156 ]. This suggests the possibility that the adult mediolateral stripe array derives from the anteroposterior patterning of dorsal <entity uuid=\"78a313ac-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">r1</entity>. A <entity uuid=\"148e967a-cbee-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Ptf1a</entity> -<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">N eurogenin 1 / 2</entity> ( <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">Neurog1 /2</entity>)- <entity uuid=\"74a067ce-cbed-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Early B - cell factor 2</entity> ( <entity uuid=\"74a067ce-cbed-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Ebf2</entity> ) regulatory network is implicated in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> subtype specification [ 49 ]. By this model, the early-born <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> cohort expresses neither <entity uuid=\"66da8c48-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Neurog1</entity> / 2 nor <entity uuid=\"74a067ce-cbed-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Ebf2</entity> and therefore expresses the <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ZII</entity> + phenotype in the adult. Soon after <entity uuid=\"f49302fe-37ca-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">E11</entity>, <entity uuid=\"66da8c48-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Neurog1</entity> / 2 is upregulated by <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">Ptf1</entity> a in the later-born <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> progenitors (e.g., [ 36 ]). In this context, <entity uuid=\"86ca9150-cbec-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">neurogenin 2</entity> regulates cell-cycle progression, neuronal output, and early dendritogenesis of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> progenitors [ 50 ], but neither <entity uuid=\"66da8c48-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Neurog1</entity> nor Neurog 2 deletions affect cortical patterning (Hawkes, unpublished observation). In turn, <entity uuid=\"66da8c48-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Neurog1</entity> / 2 + precursors express <entity uuid=\"74a067ce-cbed-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">EBF2</entity>, which represses the <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ZII</entity> + phenotype ([ 132 , 159 ]: <entity uuid=\"74a067ce-cbed-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Ebf2</entity> deletion results in transdifferentiated <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> that express markers characteristic of both the <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ZII</entity> + and <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ZII</entity> \u2212 subtypes\u2014the only manipulation known to alter a <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> subtype phenotype). In addition, <entity uuid=\"74a067ce-cbed-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Ebf2</entity> plays an anti-apoptotic role in <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ZII</entity> \u2212 <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> by locally regulating <entity uuid=\"e259ac74-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Igf1 gene</entity> expression [ 165 ]. As a result of these events, early-born <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> become <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ZII</entity> + in the adult and late-born <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> adopt the <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ZII</entity> \u2212 phenotype. Postmitotic <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> migrate dorsally from the <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity>, in part along radial glia processes ([51]: also see Section 4.1), and stack in the cerebellar plate with the earliest-born (<entity uuid=\"74a067ce-cbed-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Ebf2</entity> \u2212 ) <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> located most dorsally. Starting at ~E14, the cerebellar plate undergoes a complex redisposition, such that by <entity uuid=\"54f96796-37cb-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">E18</entity> a reproducible array of clusters of multiple molecular phenotypes is present on each side of the midline ([ 166 \u2013 170 ], etc.: reviewed in [ 171 , 172 ]) . The cellular processes that guide cluster formation are not understood but grafts of dissociated <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> also organize into discrete <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ZII</entity> +/\u2212 compartments [ 173 ], pointing to <entity uuid=\"67dac78e-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">cell-cell adhesion</entity> molecules as possible organizers: cadherins are strong candidates reviewed in [ 174 ]. Over 50 distinct clusters have been identified [ 175 , 176 ]. The mapping between embryonic clusters and adult stripes is complex: in some cases, one cluster yields a single stripe, e.g., [ 175 , 177 , 178 ], but in others single stripes derive from the fusion of several clusters, e.g., [ 179 ], or single clusters split into multiple stripes, e.g., [ 136 ]. The embryonic cluster architecture is the scaffold around which other cerebellar elements are organized. First, clusters likely restrict the distribution of cerebellar <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> and their processes (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCs</entity>\u2014[ 180 ]; Golgi cells\u2014[ 181 ]; stellate/basket cells\u2014[ 146 ]; <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity>\u2014[ 182 ]: reviewed in [ 146 ]: also glia\u2014e.g., [ 183 , 184 ]). Secondly, most afferent projections also enter the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> between E14 and <entity uuid=\"54f96796-37cb-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">E18</entity> and target specific <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> clusters (the so-called matching hypothesis\u2014reviewed in [ 185 ]). There are two major sources of sensory input to the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity>: <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CFs</entity> from the inferior olive, and mossy fibers from a number of <entity uuid=\"77f7457c-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">brain</entity> and <entity uuid=\"786b878e-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">spinal cord</entity> regions. Both afferent systems invade the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> at around E 13/14 in mouse [ 186 , 187 ], and thereafter they terminate with a spatial organization that parallels the pattern of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> stripes [ 137 , 188 ] (Fig. 6 a, b). <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> subtype organization is thought to play a key role in instructing circuit wiring into topographic maps. Spontaneous and engineered mouse mutants that display disrupted <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> stripes have equivalent alterations in the spatial arrangement of mossy fiber and <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CF</entity> terminals [ 189 \u2013 191 ]. But, what molecular mechanisms trigger cluster dispersal and wiring? From ~<entity uuid=\"54f96796-37cb-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">E18</entity>, the embryonic <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> clusters disperse, triggered by <entity uuid=\"d34023c0-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">RELN</entity> secreted by the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">EGL</entity> [ 192 \u2013 194 ]: recently thoroughly reviewed in [ 195 ]. <entity uuid=\"d34023c0-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">RELN</entity> is critical as its deletion in the reeler mouse ( <entity uuid=\"d34023c0-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Reln</entity> rl : [ 192 , 196 ] blocks dispersal, e.g., [ 128 , 197 ]). One model is that secreted <entity uuid=\"d34023c0-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">RELN</entity> binds two surface receptors on <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity>\u2014<entity uuid=\"0de3bfce-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Apolipoprotein E receptor 2</entity> and the <entity uuid=\"5bf71804-cbec-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Very Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor</entity>.

The upshot is that by ~P20, as cerebellar lobulation matures, the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> clusters string along the rostrocaudal axis into the adult array of long parasagittal stripes. However, one critical question is how do these dynamically changing stripes acquire their functional properties during development? During postnatal development, chemo- and activity-dependent mechanisms may play important (and possibly distinct) roles in establishing the afferent topographical map. There is a long-standing hypothesis that first a \u201ccrude\u201d topographic map is established by genetic cues. And one of the most compelling hypotheses postulates that cues in the afferent source domains match up with cues in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> map [ 185 ]. The molecular cues that would mediate this mechanism have not been resolved, although it may involve a chemoaffinity mechanism mediated by eph/<entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ephrin</entity> and cadherin <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity>. But, one has to also consider how the circuit is then sculpted into a \u201cfine\u201d map, and does the mechanism for refining the map also involve <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> patterning? Alternatively, are there non-genetic mechanisms that also contribute? Indeed, it was recently shown that the striped patterning of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> is disrupted when neurotransmission in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> themselves is selectively silenced [ 213 ]. Interestingly, the patterning of spinocerebellar mossy fiber terminals into distinct stripes was also altered in the absence of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> activity. The sharp stripe boundaries that are typically observed were severely compromised, although the basic features of the topographic map were left intact. These data argue that neuronal activity may play an important role in fine-tuning the cerebellar map into topographic domains. But maybe <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> are not the only players. Perhaps inhibitory <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> in the developing <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">molecular layer</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ML</entity>) or the millions of excitatory <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCs</entity> also influence circuit topography by modulating the levels of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> activity. <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity>, after all, are also organized into stripes [ 146 ] and they integrate into the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> microcircuit at a time when they could have a powerful affect on how the circuit is firing when it is wiring [ 31 ]. Which features of neuronal firing need to be examined in order to understand how circuits assemble? <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> provide the best starting point since these cells exhibit two distinct types of <entity uuid=\"5dd6e2fe-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">action potential</entity> that are experimentally tractable with in vitro and in vivo paradigms. The first are complex spikes that are triggered by <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CF</entity> inputs, and the second are simple spikes generated intrinsically within the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> but modulated by mossy fiber inputs (Fig. 6 c\u2013c\u02ba, d\u2013d\u02ba). Recent work in anesthetized and awake mice used in vivo electrophysiology to record <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> activity in postnatal mice [ 214 ]. The study found that the rate of complex spike firing increased sharply at 3\u00a0weeks of age, whereas the rate of simple spike firing gradually increased until 4\u00a0weeks of age. They also found that compared to adult, the pattern of simple spike firing during development was more irregular as the cells tended to fire in \u201cbursts\u201d that were interrupted by long pauses (Fig. 6 c, d). The regularity in simple spike firing only reached maturity at 4\u00a0weeks of age. These data show that <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> activity is dynamically sculpted throughout postnatal development, traversing several critical events that are required for circuit formation. Importantly, the establishment of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> firing properties seems to overlap with the final stages of stripe maturation [ 139 ]. However, there are also data that support an alternate view which suggests that activity-dependent mechanisms may not be involved in topographic wiring. Surgically lesioning the neonatal spinocerebellar afferent tracts did not induce a competitive sprouting of the adjacent cuneocerebellar pathway [ 215 ] and the regression of supernumerary <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CFs</entity> appears spatially and temporally unlinked to the formation\u00a0of stripe patterns\u2014both processes may be strictly dependent on molecular cues [ 216 ]. Therefore, it is interesting to speculate that compared to molecular cues, the rate and pattern of spikes, at particular ages, could shape a more subtle level of topography by refining the connectivity within stripes rather than between individual stripes. If this was to be the case, then chemical tags might define the fundamental patterns of stripes irrespective of sensory experience, and perhaps only later during postnatal development is when activity might tune and complete the existing map. The term \u201cGABAergic <entity uuid=\"cdd01df0-d8ff-11e7-b4fd-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellType\">interneuron</entity>\u201d is traditionally used to refer to a diverse set of neurons that, in the healthy adult <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity>, result in local inhibition (Fig. 7 ). Actually, it is somewhat of a misnomer since in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CN</entity> and the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GL</entity>, the majority of GABAergic <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> also use <entity uuid=\"446515a0-d110-11e5-94a7-005056be9332\" type=\"Chemical\">glycine</entity> as a co-transmitter, and a few are strictly glycinergic [ 217 , 218 ]. Distinct differences in their afferent and efferent wiring, their morphology, and the differential expression of a set of molecular markers (inter alia <entity uuid=\"bfb3af44-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">mGluR2</entity> and <entity uuid=\"739cff06-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">neurogranin</entity>) allow us to distinguish, in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GL</entity>, at least four discrete sets of Golgi cells sensu stricto as well as Lugaro and globular cells. While these clearly distinct inhibitory <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GL</entity> are sometimes collectively referred to as Golgi cells, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ML</entity> are traditionally classified as basket or stellate cells. Today, the weight of the evidence rather supports the view that these two terms describe two exemplary variants of one population that shows gradual morphological [ 219 ] and molecular [ 220 ] differences which may be secondary to their position in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ML</entity> (discussed in [ 146 ]). Lastly, the still rather enigmatic candelabrum cell [ 221 ] may be yet another member of the basket/stellate class (see [ 222 ] for a broader discussion). GABAergic <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> are produced from late embryonic life to the second postnatal week, according to a precise inside-out sequence (Fig. 7 ). The proliferation of inhibitory <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> peaks during the first postnatal week and exclusively occurs in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PWM</entity>, a postnatal niche containing heterogeneous cell types at different maturation stages [ 29 , 32 , 223 \u2013 227 ]. <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CN</entity> <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> are the first to be born during embryonic and early postnatal life, followed by <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GL</entity> <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> (Golgi and Lugaro cells) and, finally, by those of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ML</entity> (basket and stellate cells; [ 29 , 31 , 225 , 228 ]). The first studies of cerebellar <entity uuid=\"613b1244-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">neurogenesis</entity> postulated that <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ML</entity> <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> derive from the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">EGL</entity>, the only germinal layer known at that time to be active during postnatal development [ 229 , 230 ]. Later, analysis of chick-quail chimeras, transplantation experiments, and retroviral injections demonstrated that the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">EGL</entity> exclusively generates <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCs</entity> and indicated that all the GABAergic neurons, including the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ML</entity> <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity>, derive from the <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity> [ 154 , 231 \u2013 234 ]. While these diverse cells all originate from the <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity>, there is little evidence that this germinal layer is pre-patterned, say by differential <entity uuid=\"5fe6bd1c-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">gene expression</entity>, such as to presage the diversity of cerebellar inhibitory <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> in the adult. One possible exception may be the expression of <entity uuid=\"66da8c48-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Neurog1</entity>, which may distinguish the lineages leading to cerebellar cortical and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CN</entity> inhibitory <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> ([ 235 , 236 ]: the interpretation of these results is ambiguous because the BAC used may not faithfully recapitulate cognate <entity uuid=\"66da8c48-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Ngn1</entity> expression, specifically in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CN</entity> [ 235 ]). In contrast, there is compelling experimental evidence that <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PIPs</entity> maintain a high degree of plasticity and acquire their definitive fate only as they migrate through the deep cerebella mass (i.e., the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PWM</entity>) on their way into the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CN</entity> or the nascent cerebellar cortex [ 237 ]. This is particularly striking as individual subsets of cerebellar cortical inhibitory <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> withdraw from the <entity uuid=\"5f2a9d08-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">cell cycle</entity> over an extended period from E13 through the second postnatal week. However, cells collected at any point through this long generative phase are capable, when heterochronously transplanted, of acquiring a fate temporally appropriate to the host tissue [ 237 ]. Significantly, fate determination by transplanted cells is critically dependent on migration through the recipient\u2019s <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PWM</entity>. These findings have led to the recognition of the nascent <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">white matter</entity> as an instructive niche critical for the maturation and diversification of cerebellar inhibitory <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> [ 237 ]. Unfortunately, we are still quite ignorant as to how this instruction is realized on the molecular level. There is experimental evidence that <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity>-derived <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> regulates proliferation of precursors of cerebellar inhibitory <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> in and near the ventricular <entity uuid=\"c127fc3a-2a75-4ff2-9ccf-166639f30532\" type=\"Tissue\">epithelium</entity> [ 33 , 238 ]; yet, whether <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> also influence the diversification of these cells remains unclear. The dividing intermediate progenitors that are responsible for the extensive amplification of the inhibitory <entity uuid=\"cdd01df0-d8ff-11e7-b4fd-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellType\">interneuron</entity> populations strongly express <entity uuid=\"148e967a-cbee-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Ptf1a</entity> [ 33 ]. At later stages, the precursors of inhibitory <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> are seen as a population of <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">Pax-2</entity> + cells that appears in the <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity> around E12.5 and later moves into the cerebellar parenchyma [ 32 , 228 ]. The precise lineage relationships linking <entity uuid=\"148e967a-cbee-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Ptf1a</entity> + <entity uuid=\"cdd01df0-d8ff-11e7-b4fd-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellType\">interneuron</entity> progenitors to the other precursor pools in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PWM</entity> (namely, progenitors of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) remained obscure for many years. The existence of multipotent progenitors in the postnatal <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> has been proposed by two independent studies [ 239 , 240 ], in which the isolated progenitors were able to form neurospheres and to differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes both in vitro and in vivo after grafting into newborn mice [ 239 , 240 ]. A series of more recent studies have clarified the properties of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PWM</entity> progenitors and the relationships between the different lineages. For instance, it has been shown that the postnatal cerebella of mice lacking the proneural gene <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">Ascl</entity> - 1 have fewer <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">PAX-2</entity> + <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> and increased numbers of <entity uuid=\"14e3bb5c-cbec-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">SOX9</entity> + astrocytes compared to controls [ 241 ]. Conversely, overexpression of <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ASCl</entity>-1 in the <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity> results in more <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> at the expense of astrocytes [ 241 ], suggesting the existence of lineage relationships between these cell types throughout cerebellar development. It is not clear whether similar relationships between <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> and astrocytes are also present at earlier embryonic ages. Indeed, previous fate mapping analyses tagging embryonic progenitors producing <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> or <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> only rarely generated astrocytes [ 34 , 50 ], suggesting that the bulk of cerebellar astrocytes do not derive from these progenitors. Subsequent lineage analysis during embryonic and postnatal development showed that both <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> and astrocytes derive from <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ASCL</entity>-1 + precursors [ 31 ]. Similarly, fate-mapping studies of progenitors with astroglial traits\u2014such as the expression of <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">hGFAP</entity> [ 242 ], <entity uuid=\"de0b79cc-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">TenascinC </entity>[ 33 ], and <entity uuid=\"01ddcade-cbec-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">GLAST</entity> [ 227 ]\u2014reveal that the progeny of such progenitors often comprise a mixed population of astrocytes and GABAergic <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity>. In particular, in the study of Fleming et al. [ 33 ], a population of primary <entity uuid=\"b4d54f0a-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">CD133</entity> + <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">TenC</entity> + astroglial progenitors was identified in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PWM</entity> as the putative source of both <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">PTF1</entity>-a + intermediate <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">IN</entity> progenitors and <entity uuid=\"9ddeb922-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">CD15</entity> + intermediate <entity uuid=\"cdd21088-d8ff-11e7-b4fd-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellType\">astrocyte</entity> precursors. The existence of these bipotent progenitors has been confirmed by a recent study in which mixed clones of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> and astrocytes were derived from <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PWM</entity> astroglial progenitors both in vitro and in vivo [ 227 ]. Finally, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> are critical for the terminal differentiation and <entity uuid=\"5f9f8848-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">morphogenesis</entity> of cerebellar <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity>. Specifically, the complexity of basket/stellate cell axonal arborizations and their positioning on <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> is critically dependent on <entity uuid=\"2d257c84-cbef-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">neurofascin</entity> [ 243 , 244 ] and also <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">Semaphorin</entity> (<entity uuid=\"f389c546-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Sema3a</entity>)/<entity uuid=\"73edf168-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">neuropilin-1</entity>-mediated <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> between <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> and differentiating <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ML</entity> <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> [ 245 ]. Further, the preferential orientation of basket/stellate cell axons in the sagittal plane may be due to <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> guidance, as they extend in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ML</entity> [ 146 ]. Conversely, dendritic differentiation of basket/stellate cells appears primarily sensitive to <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GC</entity>-derived input, including BDNF [ 246 ] and <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> through the <entity uuid=\"b0217552-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">GluD1</entity> receptor. In fact, ablation of this receptor, which is highly expressed in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ML</entity> <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> and concentrated at their synapses with <entity uuid=\"80f98d0e-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">PFs</entity>, results in reduced survival and <entity type=\"Disease\">stunted growth</entity> of early post-migratory <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ML</entity> <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> [ 247 ]. The description of cerebellar development above is focused on the cerebellar cortex. The <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CN</entity> develop in parallel, using much of the same molecular machinery. The <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CN</entity> dictate the participation of the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> in a range of circuits by providing an almost exclusive efferent connectivity via <entity uuid=\"7fcf1bba-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">axon</entity> pathways to more caudal structures (from medial nuclei) and more rostral structures projections (from lateral nuclei; [ 248 ]). Their largely spontaneously active output can be excitatory or inhibitory and nuclei contain several different local <entity uuid=\"cdd01df0-d8ff-11e7-b4fd-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellType\">interneuron</entity> types [ 249 \u2013 253 ]. Nuclei receive collateral input from afferents to the cerebellar cortex (<entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CFs</entity> and mossy fibers) in addition to inhibitory input from <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity>. Decoding both the development and integrative function of nuclear circuits is likely to be critical for understanding the broader function of the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity>. Despite their functional significance, our knowledge of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CN</entity> development is incomplete. Furthermore, the number of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CN</entity> varies between tetrapod species suggesting that the developmental mechanisms responsible for their patterning are a key locus of evolutionary adaptation [ 254 ]. The perhaps surprising absence of a detailed description of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CN</entity> specification and maturation can to some extent be explained by a major conceptual revision of their development over the last 10\u00a0years following insights from a series of studies of <entity uuid=\"5fe6bd1c-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">gene expression</entity> [ 51 , 60 ] and genetic fate-maps [ 25 , 26 , 34 , 255 ]. Prior to this, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CN</entity>, which condense initially in a \u201c<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">nuclear transitory zone</entity>\u201d at the margin of the cerebellar <entity uuid=\"78b604c6-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">anlage</entity>, were assessed by birthdate to be derived exclusively from the <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity> [ 256 ]. This assumption was overturned by genetic lineage maps using an <entity uuid=\"fe7a0e2c-cbe9-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Atoh1</entity> reporter showing that excitatory <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CN</entity> neurons arise by tangential migration from the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity> prior to <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCP</entity> production [ 25 , 26 ]. More recent mapping using a <entity uuid=\"148e967a-cbee-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Ptf1a</entity> reporter [ 36 ] reveals that the <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity> gives rise only to inhibitory neurons of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CN</entity>. Hence, just as for the cerebellar cortex, the assembly of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CN</entity> is defined as the coordinated integration of <entity uuid=\"148e967a-cbee-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">PTF1a</entity> + and <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ATHO1</entity> + lineages in local circuits. However, patterns of temporal specification in either lineage suggest important differences compared to the cerebellar cortex in how these lineages interact. <entity uuid=\"148e967a-cbee-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Ptf1a</entity> -derived <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CN</entity> neurons are generated as the first of a sequence of inhibitory neurons destined for progressively more superficial fates [ 29 ]. To some extent, this reflects a progressive dorsal expansion of a <entity uuid=\"aa1ff888-cbed-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Gsx1</entity> + /<entity uuid=\"148e967a-cbee-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Ptf1a</entity> domain that gives rise to <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity>, which occupy the <entity uuid=\"b2559a50-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Olig2</entity> / <entity uuid=\"148e967a-cbee-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Ptf1a</entity> domain and give rise to <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> (see \u201c Specification of Cerebellar Progenitors \u201d section). However, fate determination in the former Pax - 2 + lineage is notably a product of local microenvironmental factors. Migrating <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PIPs</entity> persist in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">white matter</entity>, continuing to contribute to the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CN</entity> ([ 29 , 36 ]: see \u201c GABAergic Interneurons \u201d section) well beyond the production of the first, inhibitory projection neurons (Fig. 8 ). By contrast, cell fate in the <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ATHO1</entity> + <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CN</entity> derivatives of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity> not only correlates with birthdate [ 25 , 26 , 257 ] but appears determined at the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity> [ 258 ]. This raises the possibility that the temporal pattern of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity> derivatives establishes a template around which GABAergic neurons are organized. The allocation of a temporal framework of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity>-derived <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CN</entity> components is accompanied by a characterized sequence of transcriptional maturation [ 51 , 60 ] that results in a first born <entity uuid=\"971041e0-cbec-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">LHX9</entity> + lateral <entity uuid=\"7f79e0aa-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">nucleus</entity> (projecting to <entity uuid=\"7843da86-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">midbrain</entity> and thalamus), followed by a <entity uuid=\"2ca0c712-cbec-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">TBR1</entity> + medial (fastigial) group, which sends axons to the <entity uuid=\"7852e60c-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">hindbrain</entity> via the fasciculus uncinatus, or hook bundle [ 257 ]. The progressive deposition of cells in more dorsal (ultimately medial) positions reflects a decreasing sensitivity to <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">netrin</entity> <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> from ventral midline in migrating cells [ 259 , 260 ]. <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">Netrin</entity> receptors are also responsible for determining the laterality of the projections of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CN</entity> axons [ 261 ], which extend seamlessly from the leading processes of migrating cells [ 260 ]. Target selection itself (rostral or caudal <entity uuid=\"7802ea94-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">CNS</entity>) appears to be a property of <entity uuid=\"971041e0-cbec-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">LHX9</entity> [ 257 ] versus <entity uuid=\"2ca0c712-cbec-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">TBR1</entity> [ 59 ] expression. If this process of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity> <entity uuid=\"5de006b8-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">cell fate specification</entity> provides a template for <entity uuid=\"7f79e0aa-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">nucleus</entity> assembly, it places a special emphasis on poorly understood events at the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">NTZ</entity>. It is here that neurons segregate into a series of mediolaterally distributed nuclei as they are subducted under the rapidly expanded cortex by either passive displacement, or possibly active translocation [ 256 ]. To understand whether lineage interactions are part of this process, let alone underlying mechanisms of nucleogenesis, will rely on a better description of neurons subtypes. For example, it is unclear whether only more lateral nuclei contain inhibitory projection neurons [ 252 , 262 ] or indeed how much of the repertoire of neurons seen in the lateral <entity uuid=\"7f79e0aa-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">nucleus</entity> is recruited to other nuclei [ 263 ]. Similarly, the embedded nature of nuclei within a series of re-entrant loops that include the inferior olive, in addition to pontine neurons and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity>, has implications for later developmental events. How does the convergence of afferents onto nuclei influence the organization of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> into precise, geometric functional units [ 249 ]? These elements of fine-grained developmental detail, which are so significant for the function of the cerebellar circuit, are almost completely unexplored. In contrast to other <entity uuid=\"7802ea94-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">CNS</entity> areas in which <entity uuid=\"630a09c2-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">gliogenesis</entity> follows <entity uuid=\"613b1244-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">neurogenesis</entity>, in the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> the generation of glia parallels the generation of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCs</entity> and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity>. What triggers the activation of <entity uuid=\"630a09c2-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">gliogenesis</entity> and regulates its course in this territory is still poorly understood. In the mature mammalian <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity>, four astroglial subtypes are classically distinguished, including fibrous astrocytes in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">white matter</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">WM</entity>), stellate multipolar astrocytes with profuse tiny processes (velate astrocytes) or more slender morphologies (protoplasmic astrocytes) in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GL</entity>, and neuroepithelial cells displaying radial <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">BG</entity> basal processes spanning from the cells bodies in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> layer through the entire <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ML</entity>, up to the subpial <entity uuid=\"7f776140-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">basement membrane</entity> (Fig. 9 a, [ 130 , 229 , 264 ]). In the future, this classification may expand to comprise more astroglial subtypes based on neurochemical, topographical, and morphological criteria, as shown by a recent detailed investigation on the human <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> [ 265 ]. Through the comparative analysis of different mammalian species, Ram\u00f3n y Cajal [ 229 ] proposed that cerebellar astroglia derive from the <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity>. Cajal\u2019s interpretation has been fully proved by means of fate mapping analyses in mice in which <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">radial glial progenitors</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RG</entity>) at the ventricle were targeted based on the expression of stem-cell markers [ 266 \u2013 268 ], or <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity>-restricted tags [ 34 ]. A small contribution of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity> to cerebellar astrogliogenesis has also been proposed [ 269 ] but so far remains controversial (see [ 270 ] and references therein). As showed by anatomical investigations and functional manipulation of regulatory pathways, in a first astrogliogenic wave (up to about E14 in mouse), <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RG</entity> detach from the ventricle and displace the <entity uuid=\"8059a276-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">cell body</entity> towards the nascent <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PWM</entity>, transforming into progenitors of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">BG</entity> ([ 229 , 266 , 271 , 272 ]: the relationship between astrocytes and GABAergic <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> is reviewed in \u201cGABAergic Interneurons\u201d section). A subset of these precursors appears to be already postmitotic at the moment of translocation [ 31 ] and readily differentiates into <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">BG</entity>. Conversely, other precursors form a proliferative layer that expands [ 130 , 266 , 271 ] up to the first postnatal week in parallel with the tangential expansion of the cerebellar surface. At later stages of embryonic development, a second wave of astroglial-like progenitors lacking the basal process delaminates from the VN into the cerebellar <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PWM</entity> where they proliferate, forming astrocytes populating the prospective <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GL</entity> and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">white matter</entity> [ 130 , 271 ]. Whether <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PWM</entity> astroglial progenitors also produce some <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">BG</entity> or whether proliferating <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">BG</entity> contribute astrocytes to other cortical layers remains to be established. Similarly, the dynamics and timing of the amplification of astroglial progenitors are largely unknown. How the specialization of the astroglial subsets is achieved is only partially clarified. <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">BG</entity> <entity uuid=\"5f9f8848-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">morphogenesis</entity> requires a tight and timely regulated interaction with the surrounding cerebellar microenvironment (<entity uuid=\"7f776140-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">basement membrane</entity>, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity>, migratory and proliferative <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCs</entity>, see Fig. 9 b). Notably, impairment of these regulatory mechanisms results in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">BG</entity> malpositioning and/or the acquisition of a stellate morphology, which may thus represent a default differentiation pathway for cerebellar astroglial precursors. Yet, it is likely that the refinement of the variety of multipolar morphologies in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GL</entity> and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">WM</entity> is instructed by local cues. Further, few intrinsic determinants are known that take part in the establishment of distinct astroglial cerebellar phenotypes (see [ 270 ]). In contrast to astrocytes, so far no evidence clearly demonstrates the derivation of oligodendrocytes from the cerebellar <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity> [ 241 ]. Rather, a minor oligodendroglial fraction appears to derive from progenitors in subventricular positions, likely residing in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PWM</entity> [ 31 , 273 ]. Alternatively, mouse transplantation experiments indicate an extracerebellar origin for the majority of oligodendrocytes [ 241 ]. In line with these data, experiments in chick-quail chimeras and in <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ovo</entity> transplants in the chick <entity uuid=\"77f7457c-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">brain</entity> demonstrated that cerebellar oligodendroglia are generated in the chick mesencephalic neuroepithelium and only subsequently invade the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> via the velum medullare [ 274 ]. A similar extracerebellar source in the mammalian <entity uuid=\"77f7457c-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">brain</entity> remains to be identified. Further, fate-mapping analyses [ 242 ] support the hypothesis that the majority of cerebellar oligodendrocytes have no lineage relationships with cerebellar astrocytes (and neurons). However, ex vivo experiments [ 275 ] and functional deletion of the <entity uuid=\"0deae16a-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">polycomb group protein Bmi1</entity> [ 273 ] pointed to the existence of bipotent gliogenic precursors, whose identity remains to be established. Once settled in the cerebellar primordium, <entity uuid=\"cdd2677c-d8ff-11e7-b4fd-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellType\">oligodendrocyte</entity> progenitors first surround the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CN</entity> and gradually invade the nascent cortical lobules, progressing in a centrifugal direction. The same pattern is reflected in the course of both differentiation and <entity uuid=\"633623c2-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">myelination</entity> that proceed from the inner cerebellar portions to the lobule apices [ 276 \u2013 279 ]. Despite the fact that most intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms regulating <entity uuid=\"64ba5bd2-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">oligodendrocyte differentiation</entity> appear to be common to multiple <entity uuid=\"7802ea94-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">CNS</entity> sites, including the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> [ 280 , 281 ], a particular role in the regulation of the maturation of cerebellar oligodendroglia is exerted by <entity type=\"ChemicalClass\">thyroid hormones</entity> (<entity type=\"ChemicalClass\">TH</entity>; <entity type=\"Chemical\">L-triiodothyronine</entity>, <entity uuid=\"2d9dfb62-37cb-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">T3</entity>; L-<entity type=\"Chemical\">tetraiodothyronine</entity>, <entity uuid=\"759d3166-d110-11e5-94a7-005056be9332\" type=\"Chemical\">thyroxine</entity>, <entity uuid=\"da4bb8f0-37ca-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">T4</entity>; see \u201c The Role of <entity type=\"ChemicalClass\">Thyroid Hormone</entity> in Cerebellar Development \u201d section) and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity>-derived signals. In particular, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> secrete <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity>, which stimulates <entity uuid=\"6666f076-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation</entity> at early postnatal stages, whereas by the end of the first postnatal week, they start producing <entity uuid=\"5d1bfb96-cbec-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">vitronectin</entity>, which drives <entity uuid=\"cdd2677c-d8ff-11e7-b4fd-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellType\">oligodendrocyte</entity> maturation and myelin formation [ 282 ]. The <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> pathway has been extensively studied in the context of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCP</entity> proliferation. However, more recent studies have revealed additional roles for this important pathway during different phases of cerebellar development. The common theme emerging from these studies is that <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> is a key mitogen for the expansion of functionally diverse neuronal and <entity uuid=\"cdd1adf0-d8ff-11e7-b4fd-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellType\">glial cell</entity> types from spatially and temporally restricted precursors. However, the mechanisms by which <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> stimulates proliferation of these precursors appear to be distinct, involving both cerebellar and extracerebellar strategies (Fig. 10 ). In the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity>, Shh expression is restricted to <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> starting at E16.5 and continuing throughout adulthood [ 42 , 283 ]. The early phase of Shh expression is critical for rapid clonal expansion of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCPs</entity> as blockade of Shh expression in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> leads to drastic reduction of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCP</entity> number in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">EGL</entity> [ 62 , 283 \u2013 285 ]. The expansion of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCPs</entity> requires the <entity uuid=\"7fad29a6-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">cell surface</entity> proteins <entity uuid=\"188d9e20-cbed-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">BOC</entity> and <entity uuid=\"a614193e-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">GAS1</entity> [ 286 ], which synergistically promote <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> <entity uuid=\"84b71524-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoFunction\">binding</entity> to its receptors <entity uuid=\"bc2668a2-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">PTCH1</entity>/2. In the absence of Shh , <entity uuid=\"bc2668a2-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">PTCH1</entity> functions as a negative regulator of <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> by suppressing the activity and <entity uuid=\"65093018-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">localization</entity> of a seven-pass transmembrane protein, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">smoothened</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">SMO</entity>) to the primary <entity uuid=\"7f942942-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">cilium</entity>, a slim, <entity uuid=\"7f8ec114-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">microtubule</entity>-based non-motile structure that projects from the surface of nearly all vertebrate cells [ 287 , 288 ]. Therefore, <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> <entity uuid=\"84b71524-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoFunction\">binding</entity> to <entity uuid=\"bc2668a2-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">PTCH1</entity> relieves <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">SMO</entity> from inhibition, triggering <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> and subsequently activating downstream target <entity uuid=\"5fe6bd1c-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">gene expression</entity> mediated by the <entity uuid=\"aed3c02e-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">GLI</entity> family of transcription factors [ 289 ]. Accordingly, mutations in ciliary components that disrupt <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">SMO</entity> <entity uuid=\"65093018-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">localization</entity> to the tip of the <entity uuid=\"7f942942-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">cilium</entity> all lead to altered <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> and reduced <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCP</entity> proliferation [ 290 , 291 ]. Among the three <entity uuid=\"aed3c02e-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">GLI</entity> proteins, <entity uuid=\"aeeb2fe8-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">GLI2</entity> acts as the primary transcriptional activator in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCPs</entity> [ 292 ]. In addition to canonical <entity uuid=\"aed3c02e-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">GLI</entity> target genes <entity uuid=\"aed3c02e-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Gli1</entity> , <entity uuid=\"b13c293a-cbec-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Hhip</entity> , and <entity uuid=\"bc2668a2-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Ptch1</entity> , several others including <entity uuid=\"59217f80-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">MycN</entity> and CcndD1 involved in cell-cycle regulation of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCPs</entity> have been reported [ 293 , 294 ]. Notably, cerebellar phenotype in the absence of <entity uuid=\"59217f80-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">MycN</entity> function resembles that of Shh mutants [ 63 ]. Recent studies show that activation of <entity uuid=\"aed3c02e-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">GLI</entity>-dependent target genes is facilitated by <entity uuid=\"fe7be0a8-cbee-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">JMJD3</entity>, a H3k27me3 <entity uuid=\"1b7d7d96-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">demethylase</entity> involved in epigenetic conversion of inactive to active <entity uuid=\"7f66e9aa-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">chromatin</entity> state [ 295 ], highlighting the importance of <entity uuid=\"60715d3c-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">chromatin modification</entity> in enabling <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCPs</entity> to respond to <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> during cerebellar development. While Shh expression persists in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity>, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCPs</entity> eventually exit the <entity uuid=\"5f2a9d08-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">cell cycle</entity> and differentiate to <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCs</entity>. This process, as shown by recent studies, appears to be promoted by the transcriptional repressor <entity uuid=\"0abc91aa-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">BCL6</entity> through recruitment of BCOR co-repressor and <entity uuid=\"b47a5504-cbec-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">SIRT1</entity> <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">deacetylase</entity> to the <entity uuid=\"aed3c02e-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Gli1</entity> and <entity uuid=\"aeeb2fe8-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Gli2</entity> promoter regions, thus epigenetically silencing their expressions [ 296 ]. Removal of <entity uuid=\"45a396ea-cbec-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">p53</entity> rescues <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCPs</entity> from <entity uuid=\"5f6a45f2-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">cell death</entity> and restores their proliferation. However, it is unclear how <entity uuid=\"0abc91aa-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">BCL6</entity> is activated in the immature <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCs</entity> [ 296 ]. In addition to <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCPs</entity>, <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> is also required for the expansion of GABAergic <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> by regulating precursors in two different neurogenic niches [ 33 , 42 ]. In the <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity> niche, <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> is activated in multipotent radial glial cells after E12.5. Defective <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> in <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity> severely impairs the proliferation of radial glial cells and their ability to generate GABAergic <entity uuid=\"cdd01df0-d8ff-11e7-b4fd-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellType\">interneuron</entity> progenitors during the embryonic period [ 42 ]. Conversely, persistent activation of <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> greatly expands their numbers. The source of <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> signal acting on <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity> radial glial cells appears to be extracerebellar as <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> expression is not yet established in the emerging <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> population. Indeed, <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> is prominently expressed in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">hindbrain choroid plexus epithelium</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">hCPe</entity>), a secretory organ whose development is in close apposition with the cerebellar <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity> (Fig. 10 a). The presence of <entity uuid=\"faf590b2-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH protein</entity> in the circulating embryonic cerebrospinal fluid suggests that <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> is actively secreted from the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">hCPe</entity> and delivered to the adjacent <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity> via a transventricular mechanism. Further support for this model comes from the observation that <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity> progenitor proliferation is compromised in mice with reduced Shh expression in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">hCPe</entity> [ 42 ]. The cerebellar <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity> is also the source for stem-like astroglial cells of the secondary neurogenic niche residing in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PWM</entity> during late embryonic and postnatal period [ 33 , 239 , 242 ]. These astroglial cells transiently respond to <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity>-derived <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> and express <entity uuid=\"7fad29a6-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">cell surface</entity> marker <entity uuid=\"b4d54f0a-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">CD133</entity> (also referred to as <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">Prominin</entity>) as well as <entity uuid=\"7fda5ec6-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">extracellular matrix</entity> glycoprotein <entity uuid=\"de0b79cc-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Tenascin-C</entity> (<entity uuid=\"de0b79cc-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Tnc</entity>) [ 33 ]. Lineage analysis reveals that the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PWM</entity> astroglial cells generate intermediate progenitors of both astrocytes and GABAergic <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> as marked by the expression of <entity uuid=\"9ddeb922-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">CD15</entity> and <entity uuid=\"148e967a-cbee-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">PTF1a</entity>, respectively (Fig. 10 b) [ 33 ]. Furthermore, attenuation of <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> in astroglia during the neonatal period leads to a significant reduction of both intermediate progenitor classes, underscoring the importance of <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> in the maintenance of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PWM</entity> niche. Surprisingly, <entity uuid=\"148e967a-cbee-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">PTF1a</entity>-expressing GABAergic progenitors represent an additional population that responds to <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PWM</entity> [ 33 , 238 ]. In contrast to cerebellar <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity> [ 42 ], these <entity uuid=\"148e967a-cbee-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">PTF1a</entity>-expressing progenitors are proliferative and likely responsible for rapid expansion of the late-born GABAergic <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> during the first week of the postnatal period [ 225 ]. The most striking morphological feature of the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> of birds, mammals, and some fish is its foliation pattern, or subdivision into lobes, lobules, and sublobules that are separated by a series of fissures [ 130 , 171 , 297 , 298 ] (Fig. 11 a). In most species, the foliation pattern is symmetrical with respect to the midline, and the fissures run perpendicular to the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">anterior-posterior</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">AP</entity>) axis in the medial <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> (vermis) of most species. The mammalian <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> is further subdivided into two lateral hemispheres and adjacent flocculi/paraflocculi, each with distinct foliation patterns with fissures that vary in their orientation. Nevertheless, the lobules of the hemispheres are continuous with lobules in the vermis (Fig. 11 b). Larsell proposed a unified scheme for naming the lobules in the vermis of birds and mammals with roman numerals <entity type=\"Formula\">I\u2013X</entity> from anterior to posterior [ 299 , 300 ]. To account for the variation in foliation pattern between species and the fact that the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> has more than ten lobules in many species, lobules were subdivided into sublobules separated by shallower fissures (e.g., VIa and VIb, Fig. 11 c). The vermis of mice has eight or nine lobules, as lobules I/II are not separated in some strains and IV/V are fused, and the hemispheres have four lobules [ 301 , 302 ] that extend laterally from lobules VI and VII (Fig. 11 b, c). The basic pattern of vermis foliation is conserved throughout mammals, but foliation in the hemispheres is more variable than in the vermis and is very complex in primates (see discussion in Chapter 1 of [ 130 ], [ 303 ]). As the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> modulates the functions of all areas of the <entity uuid=\"0c41cb8b-815e-40f7-afce-035b93dcf20b\" type=\"Tissue\">neocortex</entity> [ 304 ], by extrapolation the development of the two <entity uuid=\"77f7457c-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">brain</entity> regions should have co-evolved. Indeed, the entire spinocerebellar tract projects only to the medial <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity>, thus the hemispheres are enriched for connections to the <entity uuid=\"0c41cb8b-815e-40f7-afce-035b93dcf20b\" type=\"Tissue\">neocortex</entity>. Furthermore, although the volume of the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> as a percentage of the total <entity uuid=\"77f7457c-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">brain</entity> is constant across species [ 305 , 306 ], the greatest proportional increase in <entity uuid=\"77f7457c-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">brain</entity> regions has occurred in the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> and <entity uuid=\"0c41cb8b-815e-40f7-afce-035b93dcf20b\" type=\"Tissue\">neocortex</entity> [ 306 ], and the ratio of the number of neurons in the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> to the <entity uuid=\"0c41cb8b-815e-40f7-afce-035b93dcf20b\" type=\"Tissue\">neocortex</entity> is remarkably constant across mammalian species [ 307 ]. It is therefore tempting to speculate that during evolution particular lobules in the hemispheres and folds (gyri) in the <entity uuid=\"0c41cb8b-815e-40f7-afce-035b93dcf20b\" type=\"Tissue\">neocortex</entity> of gyrencephalic mammals that house interconnected neural circuits have arisen and expanded in unison [ 308 ]. Defining the circuits between the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> and <entity uuid=\"0c41cb8b-815e-40f7-afce-035b93dcf20b\" type=\"Tissue\">neocortex</entity> in primates as well as rodents is a major challenge and high priority for future cerebellar research, but dependent on development of effective tools for tracing across multiple synapses. It will be exciting to trace the <entity uuid=\"7fcf1bba-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">axon</entity> pathways from a parasagittal stripe of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> in one region of a particular lobule through to the <entity uuid=\"0c41cb8b-815e-40f7-afce-035b93dcf20b\" type=\"Tissue\">neocortex</entity> and <entity uuid=\"780d513c-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">back</entity> to the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity>. One hypothesis is that this will reveal an elaborate spatial organization of neurons, with ones dedicated to similar functions being housed in distinct lobules in the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> and gyri in the <entity uuid=\"0c41cb8b-815e-40f7-afce-035b93dcf20b\" type=\"Tissue\">neocortex</entity>, and with new circuits discovered specific to humans. The <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> undergoes its major <entity uuid=\"6302b2f8-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">growth</entity> in the third trimester and infant stage in humans, and the first 2\u00a0weeks after birth in mice, primarily due to expansion of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCPs</entity> [ 130 , 309 , 310 ]. The surface area of the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> increases during development much more than its volume due to the formation of lobules [ 311 \u2013 314 ]. The lobules thus serve to house a large number of neurons in a layered cytoarchitecture in a small area. Foliation begins at E16.5 in the mouse with the sequential formation of the base of each fissure, which we have termed anchoring centers [ 315 ]. The <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCPs</entity>, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity>, and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">BG</entity> within anchoring centers have distinct characteristics, and the lobules grow out away from them [ 314 , 315 ]. The first sign of formation of an anchoring center is an inward thickening of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">EGL</entity> that is followed by formation of an indentation of the outer surface of the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> and elongation of the bodies of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCPs</entity> (Fig. 11 d, [ 315 ]). The underlying <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> layer indents and then the surrounding fibers of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">BG</entity> project to the base of the fissure. In the mouse vermis, four initial anchoring centers form that defines five initial lobes, which are further subdivided. Based on mutant analysis, the timing of formation and position of two adjacent anchoring centers define the morphology of the intervening lobule and thus the allocation of cells available for distinct long-range circuits [ 315 \u2013 317 ]. Importantly, the homeobox <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">engrailed</entity> genes ( <entity uuid=\"80e81c14-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">En1</entity> / 2 ) are fundamental to the patterning process as they determine when particular anchoring centers form [ 315 \u2013 320 ]. A number of theories have been proposed for how foliation is regulated [ 130 , 315 , 321 \u2013 323 ]. Fundamental questions remain, such as whether one <entity uuid=\"cec40334-d8ff-11e7-b4fd-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellType\">cell type</entity> initiates formation of anchoring centers and how are they positioned. Clonal analysis previously uncovered that <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCPs</entity> divide symmetrically to expand each clone and then differentiate en masse [ 324 ]. Surprisingly, from a clonal analysis of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCPs</entity>, we recently found that the anchoring centers act as lineage restrictions that prevent <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCPs</entity> from moving between lobules [ 325 ]. One possibility is that the restriction in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCP</entity> movement produces a mechanical force driving the lobules outward. Furthermore, the number of cells per clone in long lobules is almost twice that in short ones. In terms of clone geometry, the length is greater in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">AP</entity> than medial-lateral axis in all <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">EGL</entity> clones, especially in long lobules, accounting for the tremendous <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">AP</entity> expansion of the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> (Fig. 11 e). Moreover, in <entity uuid=\"80e81c14-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">En1</entity> / 2 mutants with smaller lobules, the size and geometry of clones is similar to wild-type clones in short lobules [ 325 ]. Thus, the dynamics of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCP</entity> expansion is differentially regulated in lobules with different shapes/sizes. Whether this is a cell intrinsic property of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCPs</entity> that form different lobules that is established before anchoring centers are formed remains to be determined. What forces within and outside the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> impact on the foliation process is an additional critical question to address. A further question is how scaling of all cell types in the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> is regulated to ensure that the correct proportions of all neurons/glia are allocated to each lobule. One interesting possibility is that <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> secreted by <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> [ 285 , 292 ] determines the expansion of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> and <entity uuid=\"cdd21088-d8ff-11e7-b4fd-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellType\">astrocyte</entity>/<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">BG</entity> progenitors in unison with regulating <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCP</entity> proliferation [ 33 , 64 , 285 , 326 ]. The <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> arose in gnathostomes, but the emergence of a stable transient amplifying population of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCPs</entity> in an <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">EGL</entity> structure that is stimulated by <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> seems to date to the transition to amniotes [ 326 \u2013 332 ]. While the production of the enormous number of granule neurons (>50\u00a0% of all neurons in mouse and human [ 333 , 334 ]) is thought to drive foliation [ 130 ] and has been experimentally linked to foliation, e.g., [ 64 , 335 ], it is important to point out that some sharks have extensively foliated cerebella [ 336 ]. Interestingly, the degree of foliation seems to correlate better with the ecological environment and/or complexity of prey <entity uuid=\"5f60847c-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">behavior</entity> within and between clades rather than with phylogeny [ 306 , 336 ]. An important question to resolve is whether the ratio of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCs</entity> to <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> is increased in sharks with highly foliated cerebella. Although it is not known whether <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> stimulates <entity uuid=\"613b1244-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">neurogenesis</entity> and of what cell types in sharks, it will be interesting to determine whether the <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> pathway has been co-opted to increase <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GC</entity> production in sharks since Shh has been detected in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> of a shark but not in zebrafish [ 327 ]. Furthermore, given the different cytoarchitecture of the shark <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity>, the mechanisms underlying foliation could be distinct from that in amniotes. Determining the similarities and differences in the foliation processes between sharks and amniotes and their implications for circuit allocation will be valuable, and likely to have implications for formation of folds in the <entity uuid=\"0c41cb8b-815e-40f7-afce-035b93dcf20b\" type=\"Tissue\">neocortex</entity> of gyrencephalic mammals. <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> in the adult <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> receive two distinctive excitatory synaptic inputs\u2014from <entity uuid=\"80f98d0e-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">PFs</entity>, the axons of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCs</entity>, and from <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CFs</entity> arising from the inferior olivary nuclei in the <entity uuid=\"78453a8e-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">medulla oblongata</entity>. Each <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> receives functionally weak but numerous (~100,000 in mice) <entity uuid=\"80f98d0e-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">PF</entity> synapses on spines of its distal dendrites. In contrast, most <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> are innervated by a single but functionally very strong <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CF</entity> on the stubby spines of their proximal dendrites. However, in the neonatal <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity>, each <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> is innervated on the soma by multiple <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CFs</entity> [ 337 ]. How is the adult one to one relationship between a <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CF</entity> and a <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> established during postnatal development? Immature olivocerebellar axons extensively ramify in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">white matter</entity> and the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GC</entity> layer, and give rise to many collaterals around <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> (creeper stage) [ 338 ]. Since immature <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> have no large primary dendrites, <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CFs</entity> terminate on perisomatic protrusions and thorns emerging from the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> somata.

During the first postnatal week, a single <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CF</entity> is selectively strengthened on the soma of each <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> (termed \u201cfunctional differentiation\u201d). Mice deficient in <entity uuid=\"1da5a5b8-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Cav2.1</entity>, the \u03b1-subunit of the P/Q-type <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">voltage-dependent Ca 2+ channel</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">VDCC</entity>), show impairment in the selective strengthening of a single <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CF</entity>, suggesting that activity-dependent Ca 2+ influx through <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">VDCCs</entity> is crucial for establishing a single \u201cwinner\u201d <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CF</entity> on each <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> [ 339 , 340 ]. Next, the strongest <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CF</entity> extends its <entity uuid=\"65bebb36-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">innervation</entity> territory from the soma to the dendrites (\u201c<entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CF</entity> translocation\u201d: Fig. 12 ). As mentioned above, <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CFs</entity> initially establish synaptic contacts on the fine processes emerging from the soma and form a plexus (\u201cpericellular nest\u201d stage) [ 229 ]. As the dendrites of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> start to grow into the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ML</entity>, from around P6, multiple <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CFs</entity> continue to innervate the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> somata until P9. After the functional differentiation of <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CFs</entity>, only the \u201cwinner\u201d <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CF</entity> extends its <entity uuid=\"65bebb36-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">innervation</entity> territory from the soma to the stem dendrites from P9 (\u201ccapuchon\u201d stage) [ 229 ]. In the \u201cdendritic\u201d stage [ 229 ], <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CF</entity> synapses undergo progressive translocation to the growing <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> dendrites. In contrast, the \u201closer\u201d <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CFs</entity> remain around the soma and are eventually eliminated in two distinct phases (the \u201cearly and late phases of <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CF</entity> elimination\u201d) mediated by distinct mechanisms [ 216 , 339 , 340 ]. The early phase of <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CF</entity> <entity uuid=\"ee6b15b0-4391-11e6-b4ab-06cfce364161\" type=\"GoProcess\">synapse elimination</entity> starts at around P7 soon after the functional differentiation is completed. Unlike the late phase of <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CF</entity> <entity uuid=\"ee6b15b0-4391-11e6-b4ab-06cfce364161\" type=\"GoProcess\">synapse elimination</entity>, the early phase is not dependent on the proper generation of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCs</entity> and <entity uuid=\"80f98d0e-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">PF</entity>-<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> synapses. Several lines of evidence suggest that neuronal activity is crucial for this event [ 339 , 340 ]. The late phase of <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CF</entity> <entity uuid=\"ee6b15b0-4391-11e6-b4ab-06cfce364161\" type=\"GoProcess\">synapse elimination</entity> starts at around <entity uuid=\"d21c4406-37ca-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">P12</entity> [ 216 , 339 , 340 ]. This process is critically dependent on the proper formation of excitatory <entity uuid=\"80f98d0e-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">PF</entity> synapses and inhibitory basket cell synapses on <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity>. In mice deficient in <entity uuid=\"bf9c4444-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">mGluR1</entity> or any of its downstream <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> molecules (G\u03b1q, PLC\u03b24, <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">PKC\u03b3</entity>), the late phase of <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CF</entity> elimination is severely impaired.

A recent study has revealed that postsynaptic <entity uuid=\"f505f700-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Sema7A</entity>, a <entity uuid=\"b6a16400-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">GPI</entity> linked subtype of <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">Semaphorin</entity>, and its receptors (<entity uuid=\"efc6dc06-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">ItgB1</entity> and <entity uuid=\"a0f0cfe6-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">PlxnC1</entity>) on <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CFs</entity> are involved in the cascade downstream of <entity uuid=\"bf9c4444-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">mGluR1</entity> [ 341 ].

Thus, semaphorins mediate retrograde signals from <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> to <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CFs</entity> that regulate multiple processes of <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CF</entity> <entity uuid=\"ee6b15b0-4391-11e6-b4ab-06cfce364161\" type=\"GoProcess\">synapse elimination</entity>. The <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> stands as a neuronal model to study dendritic differentiation. In addition to being beautiful, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> are also popular because of their convenience in terms of ease of immunohistochemical detection and genetic manipulation. Proteins such as <entity uuid=\"1fce6320-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">calbindin</entity> or <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">IP3R</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">inositol phosphate 3 receptor</entity>) are specifically abundantly expressed in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> and label their <entity uuid=\"80c9e2f2-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">dendritic tree</entity>, soma, and <entity uuid=\"7fcf1bba-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">axon</entity>. Grafting experiments have provided major progress in our understanding of the biology of neurons [ 342 ]. The L7/<entity uuid=\"3bf4f712-cbef-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">pcp2</entity> promoter drives <entity uuid=\"5fe6bd1c-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">gene expression</entity> specifically in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> and <entity uuid=\"fb657b14-d110-11e5-94a7-005056be9332\" type=\"Chemical\">retinal</entity> rod bipolar neurons [ 343 ]. Combining the L7 promoter and an inducible CRE/loxP system with in utero electroporation allows the specific <entity uuid=\"5fe6e490-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">regulation of gene expression</entity> in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> in a temporally controlled manner [ 344 ]. Furthermore, different viral vectors target <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> specifically [ 345 ] for review. Last but not least, for the study of the development of the <entity uuid=\"80c9e2f2-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">dendritic tree</entity>, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> can develop in organotypic cultures. By using this technique, the morphology of individual <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> can be studied since they are isolated from their neighbors [ 346 , 347 ]. Adult <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> are highly recognizable by their large <entity uuid=\"80c9e2f2-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">dendritic tree</entity> with prototypical morphological characteristics (Fig. 13 a). One characteristic of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> <entity uuid=\"80c9e2f2-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">dendritic tree</entity> is that its extension and ramification occurs in the sagittal plane, resembling an espaliered fruit tree [ 229 ]. This highly stereotyped and simple architecture in a two-dimensional plane is likely at the origin of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity>\u2019s popularity: many neurobiologists, among them Ferdinando <entity uuid=\"54ecea84-37cb-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">Rossi</entity>, have been fascinated by their beauty, e.g., [ 348 ]. The development of this spectacular <entity uuid=\"80c9e2f2-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">dendritic tree</entity> occurs during the first three postnatal weeks of the mouse life. Interestingly, it is not a linear process as there is a clear discontinuity at the end of the first postnatal week. During the first postnatal week, successions of <entity uuid=\"6302b2f8-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">growth</entity> and retraction have been described [ 349 , 350 ]. Immature <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> present a panel of very different morphological forms (Fig. 13 b,c). In the absence of time-lapse analyses, the relations between these different morphological forms are not yet well understood. It is only from the second postnatal week on that <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> develop their characteristic dendritic trees (Fig. 13 d). At the beginning of the second postnatal week, the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> have a single stem <entity uuid=\"e7a0008c-25c8-11e7-9224-06cfce364161\" type=\"Tissue\">segment</entity> at the apical pole that already presages the form of the mature <entity uuid=\"80c9e2f2-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">dendritic tree</entity>. During the second postnatal week, and up to the end of the third postnatal week, the <entity uuid=\"80c9e2f2-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">dendritic tree</entity> grows first wider and then taller [ 351 ]. By using virus-mediated gene transfer followed by three-dimensional reconstruction of confocal images of labeled <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity>, Kaneko et al. [ 352 ] demonstrated that <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> achieve their monoplanar configuration by the dynamic remodeling of an initially irregular arrangement extended in multiple sagittal planes during the third postnatal week in mice. The transition between these two morphological developmental phases\u2014a first phase of intense remodeling and a second phase of continuous development of the mature <entity uuid=\"80c9e2f2-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">dendritic tree</entity>\u2014occurs in parallel with profound functional transitions [ 353 , 354 ]. As they occur in parallel with a circulating peak of <entity type=\"ChemicalClass\">TH</entity> and the acquisition of the ability to walk outside the mother nest, we have proposed that these transitions are reminiscent of amphibian <entity uuid=\"5f5b8ab2-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">metamorphosis</entity> [ 354 , 355 ]. Numerous intrinsic or environmental factors regulate the dendritic development of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> (for reviews see [ 342 , 345 , 356 , 357 ]) and indeed, understanding the development and the maintenance of the <entity uuid=\"80c9e2f2-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">dendritic tree</entity> is far from being accomplished. Recent studies of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> have shed light on new mechanisms. For example, the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> is one of the rare types of neurons in which factors involved in the maintenance of <entity uuid=\"80c9e2f2-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">dendritic tree</entity> have been identified [ 358 ]. In mammals, mechanisms of dendritic self-avoidance, a critical process in patterning neural circuits during development, has also been reported in [ 359 , 360 ]. Last, in parallel to the classic neurotrophic theory for axons, developing <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> dendrites compete for limiting amounts of <entity uuid=\"7510511c-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Neurotrophin-3</entity> (<entity uuid=\"7510511c-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NT3</entity>) and require anterograde <entity uuid=\"7510511c-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NT3</entity> from their presynaptic partners in order to grow [ 361 ]. Numerous cerebellar <entity type=\"Disease\">malformations</entity> have been described in humans, primarily classified by <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">MRI</entity> studies, and can occur in isolation or as part of a broader <entity uuid=\"f41b7cbc-3940-11e6-9d30-06cfce364161\" type=\"Disease\">malformation syndrome</entity> involving multiple systems. Most cause cognitive in addition to motor and sensory integration deficits [ 362 , 363 ]. Cerebellar developmental mechanisms are well conserved between humans and rodents, making studies in mice highly informative towards defining pathogenic mechanisms. Notably, however, cerebellar development in humans begins around the ninth gestational week and continues beyond birth. This protracted developmental timeline makes the human <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> particularly vulnerable to insult, especially during 24\u201340\u00a0weeks of <entity uuid=\"5f5d07ca-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">gestation</entity>, when massive <entity uuid=\"613b1244-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">neurogenesis</entity> in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">EGL</entity> causes a fivefold increase in size of the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> [ 364 ]. Thus, while several <entity type=\"Disease\">malformations</entity> have a genetic basis, <entity type=\"Disease\">inflammation</entity>, <entity type=\"Disease\">fetal hemorrhage</entity>, and prematurity are often contributing factors. Here, we discuss some of the common and best understood human cerebellar <entity type=\"Disease\">malformations</entity> and their causes. <entity type=\"Disease\">Dandy Walker Malformation</entity> (<entity type=\"Disease\">DWM</entity>) is the most common human cerebellar <entity type=\"Disease\">malformation</entity> with an estimated incidence of 1/3000 live births [ 365 , 366 ]. <entity type=\"Disease\">DWM</entity> is an imaging diagnosis characterized by an enlarged posterior fossa, cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, and an enlarged fourth ventricle (Fig. 14 a). <entity type=\"Disease\">DWM</entity> can occur in association with agenesis of the corpus callosum, but more often occurs as an isolated finding on <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">MRI</entity> scans. <entity type=\"Disease\">DWM</entity> clinical features are variable. Patients may exhibit symptoms ranging from <entity uuid=\"88fd3890-3516-4af2-a408-609c319a947a\" type=\"Disease\">intellectual disability</entity> to <entity uuid=\"13b5b5de-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">autism</entity> or they may be completely unaware of any deficits until diagnosed as adults for unrelated reasons [ 367 \u2013 369 ]. The genetic causes of <entity type=\"Disease\">DWM</entity> remain largely unknown. However, recent studies indicate that deletions in <entity uuid=\"99e83cf8-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">FOXC1</entity> and <entity uuid=\"65d75ce4-cbec-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">ZIC1</entity> / 4 are responsible for a small subset of <entity type=\"Disease\">DWM</entity> cases [ 370 , 371 ]. Prenatal cerebellar <entity type=\"Disease\">hemorrhage</entity> however can also cause <entity type=\"Disease\">DWM</entity> [ 372 ], which may also be associated with genetic risk factors; however, these have yet to be determined. Research in animal models has led to the hypothesis that disruptions of posterior fossa <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> from the mesenchyme surrounding the <entity uuid=\"77f7457c-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">brain</entity> to the underlying embryonic <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> are key. <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">Signaling</entity> disruptions cause dramatic reductions in cerebellar <entity uuid=\"78b604c6-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">anlage</entity> neuronal progenitor proliferation, as well as abnormal migration of both <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity>- and <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity>-derived cells. This ultimately leads to foliation and lamination defects [ 370 , 373 ]. <entity uuid=\"ef26a1be-3940-11e6-9d30-06cfce364161\" type=\"Disease\">Joubert syndrome and related disorders</entity> (<entity uuid=\"ef26a1be-3940-11e6-9d30-06cfce364161\" type=\"Disease\">JSRD</entity>) is a group of disorders with an incidence of 1 in 80,000\u2013100,000 live births [ 374 , 375 ]. <entity uuid=\"ef26a1be-3940-11e6-9d30-06cfce364161\" type=\"Disease\">JSRD</entity> is characterized by cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, thick and abnormally oriented superior cerebellar peduncles, and a deep interpeduncular fossa, all of which give it the pathognomonic <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">Molar Tooth Sign</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">MTS</entity>) seen in axial <entity uuid=\"77f7457c-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">brain</entity> scan images ([ 376 ], Fig. 14 d). Patients with <entity uuid=\"ef26a1be-3940-11e6-9d30-06cfce364161\" type=\"Disease\">JSRD</entity> exhibit variable <entity type=\"Disease\">neurological symptoms</entity> such as <entity uuid=\"13d3a80a-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">ataxia</entity>, developmental delay, <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">abnormal eye</entity> movements, and altered breathing patterns. To date, ~23 genes have been identified as causative for <entity uuid=\"ef26a1be-3940-11e6-9d30-06cfce364161\" type=\"Disease\">JSRD</entity> [ 377 , 378 ]. Most have been linked to the primary cilia and its function, bringing <entity uuid=\"ef26a1be-3940-11e6-9d30-06cfce364161\" type=\"Disease\">JSRD</entity> under the umbrella of a highly heterogeneous group of disorders called <entity type=\"Disease\">ciliopathies</entity>. Studies in animal models as well as human fetal tissue from <entity uuid=\"ef26a1be-3940-11e6-9d30-06cfce364161\" type=\"Disease\">JSRD</entity> patients indicate reduced <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GC</entity> proliferation suggesting impaired <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> ([ 290 , 291 , 379 ]: see \u201c Extrinsic Regulators of Cerebellar Development: The Role of <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">Sonic Hedgehog</entity> \u201d section). Additionally, the primary cilia also plays a role in the mediation of <entity uuid=\"27f1a9d6-2122-4c71-99f9-08f952d889cc\" type=\"Pathway\">signaling pathways</entity> involving <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">WNT</entity> and <entity uuid=\"cddad7f4-d8ff-11e7-b4fd-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellType\">platelet</entity>-derived <entity uuid=\"6302b2f8-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">growth</entity> factor which can impact cerebellar <entity uuid=\"78b604c6-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">anlage</entity> fusion earlier in fetal development [ 380 , 381 ]. <entity uuid=\"ef05fd1a-3940-11e6-9d30-06cfce364161\" type=\"Disease\">Cerebellar hypoplasia</entity> (<entity uuid=\"ef05fd1a-3940-11e6-9d30-06cfce364161\" type=\"Disease\">CH</entity>) refers to underdevelopment of the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity>. This category of cerebellar <entity type=\"Disease\">malformation</entity> is distinct from <entity type=\"Disease\">DWM</entity>, as it does not involve a concomitant enlargement of the posterior fossa. <entity uuid=\"ef05fd1a-3940-11e6-9d30-06cfce364161\" type=\"Disease\">CH</entity> is also an extremely heterogeneous group of disorders, and often, other <entity uuid=\"7802ea94-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">CNS</entity> abnormalities are observed, including <entity uuid=\"15d09fdc-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">lissencephaly</entity>, <entity uuid=\"148039b2-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">microcephaly</entity>, and cortical heterotopia. <entity uuid=\"ef05fd1a-3940-11e6-9d30-06cfce364161\" type=\"Disease\">CH</entity> may be unilateral, global, vermian, or ponto-cerebellar, where in addition to the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity>, the volume of the <entity uuid=\"77fd00ac-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">pons</entity> is also reduced likely reflecting the common developmental origin of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCs</entity> and pontine nuclei neurons in the cerebellar <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity> ([ 20 , 382 ], Fig. 14 b, e). In contrast to <entity type=\"Disease\">DWM</entity>, almost all individuals exhibit cognitive and motor impairments. Several genes have been associated with <entity uuid=\"ef05fd1a-3940-11e6-9d30-06cfce364161\" type=\"Disease\">CH</entity> including mutations in <entity uuid=\"2387aa3a-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">CASK</entity> , <entity uuid=\"5c883692-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">DAB1</entity> , <entity uuid=\"7bcf7082-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">OPHN1</entity> , <entity uuid=\"d34023c0-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">RELN</entity> , <entity uuid=\"b3954242-cbed-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">CHD7</entity> , several <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">tubulin</entity> genes, and several TSEN genes [ 209 , 383 \u2013 392 ]. Each causes developmental defects in a multitude of cerebellar developmental programs, including progenitor proliferation and <entity uuid=\"5de37906-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">neuronal migration</entity> and even developmental cell survival. Notably, <entity uuid=\"ef05fd1a-3940-11e6-9d30-06cfce364161\" type=\"Disease\">CH</entity> can also occur due to a variety of non-genetic causes such as perinatal <entity uuid=\"13ed6d08-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">cytomegalovirus infection</entity> and perinatal exposure to <entity uuid=\"fb99695c-d10f-11e5-94a7-005056be9332\" type=\"ChemicalClass\">alcohol</entity> and drugs such as <entity uuid=\"d4a9dabb-4c30-4682-87ca-0a0b1cd9408b\" type=\"Dict_Chem\">cocaine</entity> [ 393 \u2013 397 ]. Cerebellar agenesis is an extremely rare anomaly distinguished by a complete or near-complete absence of the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> ([ 398 ]; Fig. 14 c). Individuals show a number of <entity type=\"Disease\">neurological deficits</entity> particularly related to movement and speech, but can be otherwise surprisingly unaffected [ 399 ]. Homozygous mutations in <entity uuid=\"148e967a-cbee-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">PTF1A</entity> have been associated cerebellar agenesis in humans [ 400 ]. In mice, <entity uuid=\"148e967a-cbee-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Ptf1a</entity> is required for the generation of all <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity>-derived GABAergic cerebellar neurons. Failure to generate these neurons means that <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity>-derived cells have no trophic support and these too are therefore lost, resulting in cerebellar agenesis in neonates [ 34 ]. Fetal <entity type=\"Disease\">hemorrhages</entity> that completely disrupt the early cerebellar <entity uuid=\"78b604c6-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">anlage</entity> have also been predicted to cause cerebellar agenesis [ 401 ]. Recent developments in neuropathology and neuroimaging have tremendously improved the diagnosis of developmental disorders of the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity>. Several genes responsible for these heterogeneous <entity type=\"Disease\">malformations</entity> have been identified and animal models have revealed novel developmental mechanisms of interest to both clinical and basic science. A deeper appreciation of the cellular and <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> mechanisms responsible for these <entity type=\"Disease\">malformations</entity> will enable improved diagnosis and potential treatment of these disorders. The importance of <entity uuid=\"2d9dfb62-37cb-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">T3</entity> and <entity uuid=\"da4bb8f0-37ca-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">T4</entity> in <entity uuid=\"5f4e1788-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">brain development</entity> has been well documented [ 402 , 403 ]. Deficiency of <entity type=\"ChemicalClass\">TH</entity> during fetal and early postnatal period results in <entity uuid=\"5c864a16-1f1f-457a-aa1e-f53f7460d00e\" type=\"Disease\">severe mental retardation</entity>, known as <entity type=\"Disease\">cretinism</entity> in humans [ 404 ]. Since there is a distinct \u201ccritical period\u201d of <entity type=\"ChemicalClass\">TH</entity> action in <entity uuid=\"5f4e1788-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">brain development</entity>, replacement of <entity type=\"ChemicalClass\">TH</entity> should be started as early as possible to prevent irreversible <entity type=\"Disease\">neurological disorders</entity>. <entity uuid=\"da4bb8f0-37ca-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">T4</entity> enters the <entity uuid=\"77f7457c-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">brain</entity> through the blood\u2013<entity uuid=\"77f7457c-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">brain</entity> barrier (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">BBB</entity>) more easily than <entity uuid=\"2d9dfb62-37cb-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">T3</entity>, an active form of <entity type=\"ChemicalClass\">TH</entity> [ 405 ]. After crossing the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">BBB</entity>, <entity uuid=\"da4bb8f0-37ca-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">T4</entity> is taken up by astrocytes and deiodinated to produce <entity uuid=\"2d9dfb62-37cb-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">T3</entity> by <entity uuid=\"662ec198-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase</entity> [ 406 ]. <entity uuid=\"2d9dfb62-37cb-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">T3</entity> is then transferred to neurons or oligodendrocytes, possibly via <entity uuid=\"0054b5ec-cbec-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">monocarboxylate transporter 8</entity> [ 407 ]. <entity type=\"ChemicalClass\">TH</entity> effects are mainly exerted through the nuclear <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">TH receptor</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">TR</entity>; TR\u03b11, TR\u03b21, and TR\u03b22), a ligand-dependent transcription factor [ 408 ]. <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">TR</entity> binds to specific <entity type=\"ChemicalClass\">DNA</entity> enhancer sequences known as the <entity type=\"ChemicalClass\">TH</entity>-response elements located in the promoter region of target genes [ 408 ]. The rodent <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> is a good model to investigate the <entity type=\"ChemicalClass\">TH</entity> action. This is partly because the rodent cerebellar development occurs largely postnatally, allowing cerebellar <entity type=\"ChemicalClass\">TH</entity> status to be precisely manipulated at various developmental stages [ 402 ]. Perinatal <entity uuid=\"144e9f38-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">hypothyroidism</entity> dramatically affects <entity uuid=\"5f9f8848-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">morphogenesis</entity> [ 402 , 403 ]: the <entity uuid=\"6302b2f8-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">growth</entity>, <entity uuid=\"5a1df977-ab00-4ee1-9b33-81350b78cd0c\" type=\"GoProcess\">dendrite arborization</entity>, and <entity uuid=\"80430f5c-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">dendrite spine</entity> formation of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> are all markedly decreased; <entity uuid=\"5f4da32a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">synaptogenesis</entity> between <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> and <entity uuid=\"80f98d0e-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">PFs</entity> is dramatically repressed; the disappearance of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">EGL</entity> is postponed as a result of the delayed proliferation and migration of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCs</entity> into the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GL</entity> [ 409 ]. <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">TRs</entity> are expressed in the most subsets of cells in the developing <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> [ 410 ]. TR\u03b11 is abundant in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCs</entity>, whereas TR\u03b21 is mainly expressed in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity>. The expression of many cerebellar genes is altered by perinatal <entity uuid=\"144e9f38-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">hypothyroidism</entity> [ 403 ]. Representative <entity type=\"ChemicalClass\">TH</entity>-responsive genes in the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> include neurotrophins such as <entity uuid=\"69888c24-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">nerve growth factor</entity>, BDNF, <entity uuid=\"7510511c-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NT3</entity>, and <entity uuid=\"752c5b5a-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">NT-4/5</entity>, and receptors such as the <entity type=\"Chemical\">inositol trisphosphate</entity> 3 receptor, and <entity uuid=\"db6f1f60-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor \u03b1</entity>, <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">hairless</entity>, and <entity uuid=\"1bff6a7c-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">myelin basic protein</entity> [ 411 , 412 ]. The expression of many of these genes is regulated by <entity type=\"ChemicalClass\">TH</entity> only during a limited period of development.

Thus, <entity type=\"ChemicalClass\">TH</entity> sensitivity may be controlled by other unknown epigenetic mechanisms such as <entity uuid=\"5eaf99c8-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">DNA methylation</entity> and <entity uuid=\"607179b6-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">histone modification</entity>. Various animal models have been used to study <entity type=\"ChemicalClass\">TH</entity> in cerebellar development [ 414 ]. Interestingly, <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">TR\u03b1</entity> knock-out mice, <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">TR\u03b2</entity> knock-out mice and <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">TR\u03b1</entity>/<entity type=\"GeneProtein\">TR\u03b2</entity> double knock-out mice do not display obvious cerebellar defects, suggesting that most of the consequences of <entity uuid=\"13e9ba00-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">congenital hypothyroidism</entity> in the <entity uuid=\"77f7457c-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">brain</entity> are due to the detrimental activity of unliganded <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">TR</entity>. This hypothesis is supported by studies of transgenic animals expressing mutant <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">TR</entity>, which show severe neurodevelopmental defects [ 415 , 416 ]. Although these animal models have contributed greatly to our understanding on the role of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">TR</entity> in cerebellar development, these may not sufficiently address the mechanisms of direct <entity type=\"ChemicalClass\">TH</entity> action. Since <entity type=\"ChemicalClass\">TH</entity> acts not only in the <entity uuid=\"77f7457c-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">brain</entity> but also in the peripheral organs, <entity uuid=\"5f4e1788-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">brain development</entity> may be affected by peripheral metabolic changes. Thus, cell or organ-specific inhibition/activation of <entity type=\"ChemicalClass\">TH</entity> action is required. For such purpose, Fauquier et al. [ 417 ] used a L7/<entity uuid=\"3bf4f712-cbef-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Pcp2</entity> promoter to generate transgenic mice that express a mutant TR\u03b11 specifically in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> after P8. Probably because the timing of transgene expression is slightly after the critical period, this mouse showed only limited alterations in cerebellar <entity uuid=\"5f9f8848-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">morphogenesis</entity>. On the other <entity uuid=\"e79b72d8-25c8-11e7-9224-06cfce364161\" type=\"Tissue\">hand</entity>, by <entity uuid=\"148e967a-cbee-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Ptf1a</entity>-Cre recombination, mutant TR\u03b11 was expressed in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> and GABAergic <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> from prenatal stages, showing the alteration of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> <entity uuid=\"5f9f8848-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">morphogenesis</entity> [ 417 ]. We have also generated a transgenic mouse using mutant human TR\u03b21 with L7 / <entity uuid=\"3bf4f712-cbef-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Pcp2</entity> promoter (Fig. 15 ; [ 418 ]). Expression of mutant TR\u03b21 was observed as early as <entity uuid=\"f2d46340-37ca-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">P2</entity>. This mouse showed decreased <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> dendritic arborization and lower levels of expression of <entity type=\"ChemicalClass\">TH</entity>-regulated genes in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity>. To our surprise, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GC</entity> migration was also retarded and the expression of <entity type=\"ChemicalClass\">TH</entity>-regulated genes in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCs</entity> and oligodendrocytes was also decreased. As a possible consequence, this mouse shows <entity uuid=\"13d3a80a-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">cerebellar ataxia</entity>. These studies indicate that <entity type=\"ChemicalClass\">TH</entity> may mainly act through <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">TR</entity> in the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> to regulate the whole cerebellar development. Additional factors that transmit <entity type=\"ChemicalClass\">TH</entity> <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> to other subsets of cells are required. Furthermore, although it is usually considered that the critical period for <entity type=\"ChemicalClass\">TH</entity> action in the rodent <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> is the first two postnatal weeks, the actual critical period may be earlier. Disruption of <entity type=\"ChemicalClass\">TH</entity> action by environmental factors during the critical period may produce adverse effects [ 419 ]. The <entity type=\"Disease\">cerebellar ataxias</entity> comprise a heterogeneous group of <entity type=\"Disease\">neurological disorders</entity> characterized by gait disturbances, <entity type=\"Disease\">motor incoordination</entity> and imbalance, <entity uuid=\"299928e6-be57-4457-a619-9fdb97508116\" type=\"Disease\">dysarthria</entity>, and oculomotor deficits [ 420 , 421 ]. The etiology of <entity uuid=\"13d3a80a-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">cerebellar ataxia</entity> is complex and includes acquired causes as well as a steadily growing number of inherited conditions [ 421 \u2013 423 ]. The genetic <entity type=\"Disease\">ataxias</entity> are usually progressive. For many of these disorders, pathologic changes in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> and a substantial loss of these neurons resulting in <entity uuid=\"157b65c6-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">cerebellar atrophy</entity> are thought to cause the symptoms of the <entity uuid=\"c7eae097-1e9f-4bfa-9c9d-bc81c7d800b3\" type=\"Pathway\">disease</entity>. However, accumulating evidence from cell- and animal-based models of <entity uuid=\"13d3a80a-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">cerebellar ataxia</entity> suggest that abnormal <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> development and related early changes in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> physiology might contribute to the <entity uuid=\"c7eae097-1e9f-4bfa-9c9d-bc81c7d800b3\" type=\"Pathway\">disease</entity>, thus challenging our view of <entity type=\"Disease\">cerebellar ataxias</entity> as pure <entity type=\"Disease\">neurodegenerative disorders</entity>. Here, I briefly review the emerging concept that <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> developmental abnormalities might be contributing to <entity uuid=\"c7eae097-1e9f-4bfa-9c9d-bc81c7d800b3\" type=\"Pathway\">disease</entity> <entity uuid=\"5f93b9b4-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">pathogenesis</entity> in <entity uuid=\"13d3a80a-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">cerebellar ataxia</entity>. <entity uuid=\"178ecac4-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1</entity> (<entity uuid=\"178ecac4-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">SCA1</entity>) is caused by a <entity uuid=\"2f9f843a-37cb-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">CAG</entity> repeat expansion in the <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">Ataxin1</entity> ( <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ATXN1</entity> ) gene and is one of the most intensely studied dominant <entity type=\"Disease\">ataxias</entity>. Numerous mouse and other animal models have been generated for <entity uuid=\"178ecac4-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">SCA1</entity> that recapitulate different aspects of the human <entity uuid=\"c7eae097-1e9f-4bfa-9c9d-bc81c7d800b3\" type=\"Pathway\">disease</entity>. For example, both transgenic mice overexpressing expanded <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ATXN1</entity> [ 82Q ] as well as knock-in mice ( <entity uuid=\"178ecac4-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">SCA1</entity> 154Q/2Q ) exhibit motor impairments and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> degeneration [ 424 ]. Interestingly, transgenic mice in which expression of the expanded transgene is delayed until well after the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> has matured display a much reduced <entity uuid=\"c7eae097-1e9f-4bfa-9c9d-bc81c7d800b3\" type=\"Pathway\">disease</entity> phenotype, suggesting that mutant <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ATXN1</entity> interacts with a pathway involved in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> development [ 425 ]. Indeed, the same study demonstrated a key interaction of <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ATXN1</entity> with <entity uuid=\"dca36d2c-d10f-11e5-94a7-005056be9332\" type=\"Chemical\">retinoic acid</entity>-related <entity uuid=\"87a63f54-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">orphan nuclear receptor</entity> \u03b1 (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ROR\u03b1</entity>), a transcription factor critical for cerebellar development. Moreover, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ROR\u03b1</entity> expression levels were found to be reduced in the <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ATXN1</entity> [ 82Q ] model [ 425 ]. Taken together, the results of this landmark study provided the first functional genetic evidence that compromising <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> development contributes to the severity of <entity uuid=\"157b65c6-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">neurodegeneration</entity>. Subsequent studies have shown that <entity uuid=\"178ecac4-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">SCA1</entity> transgenic mice display abnormalities in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> development, including a reduction of <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CF</entity> translocation along the developing <entity uuid=\"80c9e2f2-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">dendritic tree</entity> and decreased pruning of <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CF</entity> terminals from the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> soma [ 426 , 427 ]. Similarly, profound impairments in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> dendritogenesis, spine development, and <entity uuid=\"5f4da32a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">synaptogenesis</entity> have been described in the staggerer mouse [ 428 , 429 ], which harbors an autosomal recessive mutation in the <entity uuid=\"db6f1f60-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Rora gene</entity> encoding <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ROR\u03b1</entity>, and is viewed by some as an extreme model of <entity uuid=\"178ecac4-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">SCA1</entity> [ 429 ]. Other studies have demonstrated similar <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> developmental abnormalities in different mouse models of degenerative <entity type=\"Disease\">cerebellar ataxias</entity>. A <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity>-specific transgenic mouse model that expresses a truncated form of expanded human <entity uuid=\"23aeb3cc-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Ataxin-3</entity>, the <entity uuid=\"c7eae097-1e9f-4bfa-9c9d-bc81c7d800b3\" type=\"Pathway\">disease</entity> protein causing <entity uuid=\"1553fc70-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">SCA3</entity>, displays disarrangement of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> and poor <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> dendritic arborization [ 430 , 431 ]. As described above for <entity uuid=\"178ecac4-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">SCA1</entity>, the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> in this <entity uuid=\"1553fc70-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">SCA3</entity> model express decreased levels of the <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">developmental transcription factor</entity> <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ROR\u03b1</entity> [ 431 ], suggesting a potential molecular link between the observed developmental abnormalities in both models. Impaired dendritic arborization of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> as well as abnormal spine <entity uuid=\"5f9f8848-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">morphogenesis</entity> have also been described in mice lacking \u03b2 <entity uuid=\"18afab06-cbec-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">-III spectrin</entity>, a model of <entity uuid=\"18afab06-cbec-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">SCA5</entity> [ 432 ]. Similarly, cultured <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> overexpressing <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">PKC\u03b3</entity> with <entity uuid=\"b2a54b54-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">SCA14</entity>-causing mutations after adenoviral <entity uuid=\"13e3bd26-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">infection</entity> display a decreased dendritic arbor as well as decreased spine density [ 433 ]. In vivo lentiviral-mediated expression of mutant <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">PKC\u03b3</entity> in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> led to impaired pruning of <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CF</entity> synapses from developing <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity>, although no dendritic abnormalities were observed [ 434 ]. However, the recently reported transgenic <entity uuid=\"b2a54b54-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">SCA14</entity> mouse model shows abnormal dendritic development of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> both in vivo as well as in organotypic slice cultures [ 435 ]. Besides models of the human SCAs, several other genetic mouse mutants have highlighted the relationship between abnormal <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> development and <entity uuid=\"13d3a80a-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">ataxia</entity>. For example, the <entity type=\"Disease\">ataxic</entity> <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">Moonwalker</entity> ( <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">Mwk</entity> ) mouse harbors a dominant gain-of-function mutation in the <entity uuid=\"4a18765a-cbec-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">TRPC3</entity> ion channel, resulting in adult-onset <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> loss but also impairments in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> dendritic arborization during cerebellar development [ 436 ]. <entity uuid=\"4a18765a-cbec-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">TRPC3</entity> is a key player in the <entity uuid=\"bf9c4444-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">mGluR1</entity> <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> pathway vital for <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> function [ 437 , 438 ]. Interestingly, impaired <entity uuid=\"bf9c4444-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">mGluR1</entity> <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> has been demonstrated in a number of the mouse models described above including <entity uuid=\"178ecac4-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">SCA1</entity> [ 439 , 440 ], <entity uuid=\"1553fc70-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">SCA3</entity> [ 441 ], and <entity uuid=\"18afab06-cbec-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">SCA5</entity> [ 442 ] models. Future research should help to clarify whether there is a causal relationship between impaired <entity uuid=\"bf9c4444-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">mGluR1</entity> <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> at <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity>-<entity uuid=\"80f98d0e-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">PF</entity> synapses and developmental <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> abnormalities in these and other models of <entity uuid=\"13d3a80a-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">ataxia</entity>. In summary, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> developmental abnormalities are clearly evident in a wide range of <entity type=\"Disease\">ataxic</entity> mouse mutants including models of the degenerative SCAs. The observed <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> developmental defects commonly include impaired dendritic arborization, resulting in synaptic deficits affecting <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CF</entity> and <entity uuid=\"80f98d0e-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">PF</entity> connections and ultimately altering <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> physiology. It will be important to better understand the underlying\u2014likely common\u2014molecular mechanisms by which mutations in distinct genes cause abnormal <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> development and function. These could offer attractive future therapeutic targets to alleviate motor dysfunction in <entity uuid=\"13d3a80a-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">cerebellar ataxia</entity>. <entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MB</entity> is the most common pediatric <entity uuid=\"f0753893-2f13-403f-9298-166632b95c71\" type=\"Disease\">brain tumor</entity> and is the most common cause of pediatric death from <entity uuid=\"1780cae6-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">cancer</entity>. Histologically, cases are classified into classic, nodular/<entity type=\"Disease\">desmoplastic</entity>, and large cell/<entity type=\"Disease\">anaplastic</entity> subtype [ 443 ], and prognosis is performed by combining histological subtype, clinical markers, namely, age, <entity type=\"Disease\">metastatic</entity> stage, and level of resection, as well as selected molecular markers. Morphologically, <entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MB</entity> cells closely resemble <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCs</entity> and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCPs</entity>; hence, it has been long postulated that a link exists between these <entity type=\"Disease\">tumors</entity> and the normal development of the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity>. Evidence gained from candidate gene approaches in mouse models and more recently \u201c-omics\u201d screening of large <entity uuid=\"14909b22-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">tumor</entity> series has shown deregulation of specific developmental pathways in subgroups of these <entity type=\"Disease\">tumors</entity>. The current consensus is that <entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MB</entity> can be sub-classified based on genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic characteristics [ 444 , 445 ] into four distinct subgroups (Fig. 16 ): <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">WNT</entity>, <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity>, Group 3, and Group 4 [ 445 ]. The <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">WNT</entity> and <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> subgroups have been associated with constitutive activation of the <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">WNT</entity>/<entity uuid=\"57f4e030-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">\u03b2-catenin</entity> and <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> pathways, respectively, whereas Group 3 and Group 4 <entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MBs</entity> are less well characterized. Each of these subgroups have defining demographic, clinical, genetic, and epigenetic profiles, and emerging evidence links their origin to different cerebellar progenitor cells at different developmental time points. Here, we will summarize the key features of the current molecular stratification of <entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MB</entity> from a developmental oncobiology perspective. <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCPs</entity> are the main cell of origin of <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity>-<entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MB</entity>, as shown in mouse models in which <entity uuid=\"bc2668a2-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Ptch1</entity> is conditionally inactivated in <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCPs</entity>. Importantly, constitutive activation of <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> <entity uuid=\"61458f3a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">signaling</entity> induces <entity type=\"Disease\">neoplastic transformation</entity> of more undifferentiated progenitor cells only upon commitment toward a <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GC</entity> lineage [ 446 ]. Pre-<entity type=\"Disease\">neoplastic</entity> lesions expressed <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">Atho1</entity> , a marker of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GC</entity> lineage, and showed activation of <entity uuid=\"aed3c02e-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Gli1</entity> , <entity uuid=\"286e265a-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Cyclin D1</entity> , and <entity uuid=\"59217f80-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">MycN</entity> , which are <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> target genes. Their <entity uuid=\"5fe6bd1c-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">gene expression</entity> profiles were more similar (differing by 34 genes) to <entity uuid=\"14909b22-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">tumor</entity> cells than <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCPs</entity> (differing by 75 genes) [ 447 ]. <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity>-<entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MBs</entity> have also been shown to originate from cells located in the cochlear nuclei of the <entity uuid=\"786eb454-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">brainstem</entity> [ 448 ]. <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">MRI</entity> studies have shown differences in the location of <entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MB</entity> subgroups, and <entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MB</entity> location (as well as enhancement pattern) can predict the molecular subgroup of pediatric <entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MBs</entity>. <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> <entity type=\"Disease\">tumors</entity> are mainly detected within the cerebellar hemispheres [ 449 \u2013 451 ] consistent with a <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCP</entity> cell of origin.

Human Shh <entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MBs</entity> [ 445 ] have a 1:1 male-to-female ratio and a bimodal age distribution (very frequently seen in infants and adults), with a good prognosis in infants but an intermediate prognosis in other age groups. All histological nodular/<entity type=\"Disease\">desmoplastic</entity> <entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MBs</entity> are likely <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity>-<entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MBs</entity> [ 452 ], but 50\u00a0% of <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity>-<entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MBs</entity> are of other morphology.

These studies also showed that the genes characterizing human <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">WNT</entity>-<entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MBs</entity> are more often expressed in the lower <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity> and embryonic dorsal <entity uuid=\"786eb454-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">brainstem</entity> than in the upper <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity> of the developing <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity>. In addition, transcriptome analysis showed that the <entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MBs</entity> arising in these mice matched human <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">WNT</entity>-<entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MBs</entity>. <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">MRI</entity> studies in patients have shown that <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">WNT</entity> <entity type=\"Disease\">tumors</entity> are often found within the fourth ventricle (cerebellar peduncle/cerebellopontine angle cistern) and infiltrated the dorsal <entity uuid=\"786eb454-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">brainstem</entity> [ 449 , 450 ], with the majority of them being continuous with the cuneate <entity uuid=\"7f79e0aa-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">nucleus</entity> [ 451 ], a region that corresponds to the origin defined for the murine <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">WNT</entity>-<entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MBs</entity> described above. Human <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">WNT</entity>-<entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MBs</entity> [ 445 ] have a 1:1 male-to-female ratio and occur at all ages (uncommon in infants). They have a very good long-term prognosis in comparison to the other subgroups of <entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MB</entity> (survival rate likely exceeds 90\u00a0% with current treatment). The large majority of <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">WNT</entity>-<entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MBs</entity> investigated so far have classic histology. Cerebellar stem cells are a third likely cell of origin for human <entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MBs</entity>. Models using Rb + <entity uuid=\"45a396ea-cbec-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Tp53</entity> mutant mice were generated where <entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MBs</entity> developed from neural stem cells in the cerebellar <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">white matter</entity> [ 453 , 454 ]. These <entity type=\"Disease\">tumors</entity> resembled human Group 3 <entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MBs</entity> histologically while expressing high levels of <entity uuid=\"cdc75f80-d8ff-11e7-b4fd-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellType\">neural stem cell</entity> markers (<entity uuid=\"6647bc56-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Nestin</entity>, <entity uuid=\"145134b2-cbec-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Sox2</entity>, and <entity uuid=\"14e3bb5c-cbec-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Sox9</entity>). A further model using Myc + <entity uuid=\"45a396ea-cbec-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Tp53</entity> mutant mice developed <entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MBs</entity> from cerebellar neural stem cells and from <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCPs</entity>, although the <entity type=\"Disease\">tumors</entity> that formed from <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCPs</entity> lost their lineage specific markers first [ 455 ]. This model expressed high levels of <entity uuid=\"cdc75f80-d8ff-11e7-b4fd-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellType\">neural stem cell</entity> genes and also resembled human Group 3 <entity type=\"Disease\">tumors</entity> at a histological and molecular level. In the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">MRI</entity> studies to date, Group 3 and Group 4 <entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MBs</entity> are characterized by <entity uuid=\"786eb454-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">brainstem</entity> contact with most of the <entity type=\"Disease\">tumors</entity> growing within the vermis. Most also contact both the cochlear and cuneate nuclei and always infiltrate the fourth ventricle [ 450 , 451 ]. Group 3 <entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MBs</entity> [ 445 ] are seen more frequently in males than females and almost never in adults, have a poor prognosis, and are frequently <entity type=\"Disease\">metastatic</entity>. Group 3 <entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MBs</entity> most frequently have a classic morphology, but the Group 3 subgroup contains the majority of the large cell/<entity type=\"Disease\">anaplastic</entity> <entity type=\"Disease\">tumors</entity>. Group 4 comprises 30\u00a0% of <entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MBs</entity> and it is the least well characterized molecularly. At present, it is also unclear from which cells these <entity type=\"Disease\">tumors</entity> originate. This subgroup has a male-to-female ratio of 2:1 and has an intermediate prognosis, similar to the <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity> subgroup [ 445 ]. Group 3 and Group 4 <entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MBs</entity> share some molecular features: amplification of the <entity uuid=\"7ec92418-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">OTX2</entity> oncogene, which is not seen in the other subgroups, and <entity type=\"Disease\">isochromosome</entity> 17q (26\u00a0% in Group 3 and 66\u00a0% in Group 4 <entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MBs</entity> [ 447 ]). However, there are also important differences. Group 3 <entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MBs</entity> show high levels of <entity uuid=\"58d4fd72-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">MYC</entity>, and often gain of <entity uuid=\"7f7ed39e-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">chromosome</entity> 1q and/or loss of <entity uuid=\"7f7ed39e-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">chromosome</entity> 5q and 10q, whereas Group 4 <entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MBs</entity> have low levels of <entity uuid=\"58d4fd72-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">MYC</entity> and <entity uuid=\"59217f80-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">MYCN</entity> and loss of the <entity uuid=\"7f6934b2-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">X chromosome</entity> in 80\u00a0% of females within the subgroup [ 445 ]. In summary, \u201c-omics\u201d datasets on large series of <entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MB</entity> combined with the results of ontogeny studies performed in mouse models aiming at characterizing the cell of origin of the various subgroups together with <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">magnetic resonance imaging</entity> (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">MRI</entity>) studies in patients lend additional support to the notion that <entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MB</entity> is in fact a <entity uuid=\"c7eae097-1e9f-4bfa-9c9d-bc81c7d800b3\" type=\"Pathway\">disease</entity> arising from deregulated cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the development and <entity uuid=\"633733d4-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">homeostasis</entity> of the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity>. The goal of our consensus paper is to provide an updated view of our current knowledge on cerebellar development. The broad spectrum of the work reviewed in such a short format leaves little room for specific debate. Nevertheless, many of the concepts reported here have already reached consensus. The seminal discovery of the \u201c<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">isthmic organizer</entity>\u201d and its inductive role has led to an understanding of the molecular <entity uuid=\"5e5c9fc0-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">regionalization</entity> of the neural tube with its precise frontiers between domains expressing homeobox-containing genes. The interface between caudal <entity uuid=\"a79cc850-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">GBX2</entity> and rostral <entity uuid=\"7ec92418-cbeb-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">OTX2</entity> expressing domains marks the location of the \u201c<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">isthmic organizer</entity>\u201d which, through <entity uuid=\"94174abc-cbea-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">Fgf8</entity> <entity uuid=\"64784e7c-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">secretion</entity>, initiates the molecular cascade required for the specification of <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity>. Next come the germinal epithelia of the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity>. For over a century, the <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> was known for the dual origins of its neuronal populations: the <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity> and the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity>. However, the categories of neurons generated in each of these epithelia have only recently been established. Genetic fate mapping proved that glutamatergic neurons (most of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CN</entity> neurons, and all <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GCs</entity> and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">UBCs</entity>), specified by the transcription factor <entity uuid=\"fe7a0e2c-cbe9-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">ATOH1</entity>, originate from the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">RL</entity> and migrate via the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">EGL</entity>. In contrast, GABAergic neurons (<entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity>, <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">ML</entity> <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity>, Lugaro and Golgi cells, and GABAergic neurons of the <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">CN</entity>), specified by <entity uuid=\"148e967a-cbee-11e5-a271-005056be9332\" type=\"GeneProtein\">PTF1a</entity>, originate from the <entity uuid=\"788c4712-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">VZ</entity>. Moreover, both neuroepithelia are divided into subdomains, each one specified by distinct transcription factors to generate the corresponding population of neurons. Following specification comes <entity uuid=\"5de37906-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">neuronal migration</entity> and differentiation. Despite recent progress, the data are less complete. For example, broad areas of the early development of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> remain obscure, even while later events such as dendritogenesis are well understood. Our knowledge on the mechanisms leading to the biochemical heterogeneity of <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> and their aggregation into longitudinal and transverse compartments has improved: there is a dichotomy among <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity>, those born between E10\u00a0and <entity uuid=\"f49302fe-37ca-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">E11</entity>.5 will become <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ZII</entity> + and those born later will be <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">ZII</entity> \u2212 , indicating that specification might exist among progenitors. Related to <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PC</entity> compartmentalization, the formation of circuit topography and the elimination of <entity uuid=\"805a1f76-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoComponent\">CF</entity> multiple <entity uuid=\"65bebb36-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">innervation</entity> opens the vast domain of <entity uuid=\"5f4da32a-d186-11e5-856b-005056be9332\" type=\"GoProcess\">synaptogenesis</entity> and the role of functional activity in the fine-tuning of the cortical circuit\u2019s specificity\u2014a chapter that, at this moment, remains little explored and is an anticipated topic for future consensus papers. Similarly, the ways in which cerebellar <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">INs</entity> and glia become integrated into the mature <entity uuid=\"78537a9a-2279-11e6-9396-005056be9332\" type=\"Tissue\">cerebellum</entity> are also beginning to be understood. Finally, in parallel with these events, we are now seeing how the development of the characteristic cerebellar foliation fits into the picture. We have also updated on the role of the <entity type=\"ChemicalClass\">TH</entity> (a cerebellists\u2019 old friend because of its multiple effects on cerebellar development) describing recent advances using transgenic animals with conditional nuclear <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">TH receptor</entity> knock-outs targeted to <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> or/and <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">IN</entity> that allow for the suppression of secondary effects on other neurons or peripheral organs. Finally, our review has briefly touched upon cerebellar pathology. For example, the analysis of the role of <entity type=\"GeneProtein\">SHH</entity>, secreted by <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">PCs</entity> as mitogen for <entity type=\"Abbreviations\">GC</entity> proliferation, provides a basis for better understanding of the origins of <entity uuid=\"147970c8-d185-11e5-b75f-005056be9332\" type=\"Disease\">MBs</entity>, and <entity type=\"Disease\">inherited disorders</entity> of cerebellar development can now be placed in a stronger developmental context. In conclusion, following the outline proposed by Ferdinando <entity uuid=\"54ecea84-37cb-11e6-9af5-06cfce364161\" type=\"CellLine\">Rossi</entity> in his planned monograph, the data presented here
