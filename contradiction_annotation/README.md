# Annotation System for Contradictory Pairs

The annotation system for tagging contradictory pairs is built as a PHP/MySQL/Bootstrap application. The code to create and load the database is in the py/ directory. The PHP code for displaying the annotation system is in the php/ directory.

Below is an example screenshot of the annotation platform. It presents the user with two supposedly contradictory statements. The user must then dive into the papers to understand if the sentences are actually contradictory or if there is some mitigation and annotate accordingly.
